Han Li's heart jolted upon seeing this, and he immediately made a hand seal, upon which both of his extreme mountains swelled to around 10,000 feet in size before crashing down violently from above.

Two resounding booms rang out as the surface of the light barrier warped and twisted, but the two mountains were also repelled while the light barrier remained completely unscathed.

The 13 Purple-striped Gold Devouring Beetles also crashed into the light barrier one after another, and the air around the barrier tremored, seemingly attempting to repel the beetles as well.

However, the 13 Purple-striped Gold Devouring Beetles suddenly let loose sharp screeches and expanded to several feet in size each. They then extended their limbs, which released layers of silver light, then plunged into the space near the light barrier like a series of steel needles.

The space near the light barrier was still twisting and tremoring incessantly, but the Purple-striped Gold Devouring Beetles remained completely unmoved, as if they had taken root there.

Immediately thereafter, the Purple-striped Gold Devouring Beetles opened their mouths to expel a golden thread each, which pierced straight through the light barrier, completely disregarding its defensive powers.

The rainbow light barrier suddenly tremored, following which bursts of rainbow light surged directly toward the Purple-striped Gold Devouring Beetles in a frenzy along the golden threads.

Within the span of just a few breaths, the light barrier had thinned and dimmed significantly, seemingly leaking spiritual power at a rapid rate.

The two puppets seemed to falter slightly upon seeing this, but rainbow light then immediately erupted from their hands again before surging in all directions.

The light barrier flashed and was bolstered by the influx of rainbow light, but the 13 Purple-striped Gold Devouring Beetles were clearly drawing spiritual power from the light barrier at an astonishing rate. Even though the two puppets clearly possessed other powerful abilities, they were locked in a stalemate with the beetles.

Han Li was initially rather taken aback to see this, but a hint of elation then quickly appeared in his eyes. He made a hand seal, and the 72 flying swords around him immediately transformed into hundreds of sword projections, then converged to form a giant azure sword that was around 100 feet in length.

Han Li pointed a finger toward the giant sword before him and uttered a single word. "Slash!"

The giant sword immediately came crashing down as a streak of azure light.

Perhaps the Azure Bamboo Cloudswarm Swords weren't as versatile as the silver ruler, but the combined might of all 72 swords was far above that of the silver ruler.

Furthermore, this set of flying swords was Han Li's bonded treasure, and having been nurtured by him for so many years, it had developed a hint of spiritual nature on top of becoming far more powerful as his cultivation base had progressed.

Even though that rainbow light barrier was extremely profound, it was already struggling against the 13 Purple-striped Gold Devouring Beetles, so Han Li was confident that this sword strike would be able to shatter it.

However, right at this critical juncture, something unexpected suddenly happened.

In the instant that the giant azure sword came crashing down from above, spatial fluctuations suddenly erupted above Han Li as a ball of black light emerged. The black light then flashed to form five huge identical runes, and a dull thump rang out as a burst of enormous force came crashing down from above, as if five massive mountains had descended from the heavens at once.

If a normal Body Integration Stage human cultivator with a far inferior physical constitution had been standing in Han Li's place, their physical body would've instantly been destroyed by this devastating crushing force.

At the same time, a small purple cauldron emerged silently beneath Han Li.

Black light swept forth from the cauldron, and three other ancient black runes emerged.

As soon as these three runes appeared, Han Li's body was completely immobilized, as if it had been bound by iron chains, and his magic power also ceased to circulate.

On top of that, blue light flashed beside Han Li, and a transparent puppet that resembled an ice statue appeared out of thin air, then slashed a giant transparent sword toward Han Li with devastating force.

Meanwhile, faint golden light flashed on his other side, and the devilish beauty from the Yin Yang Twin Devils appeared with a sinister look on her face before raising both of her hands up into the air.

A ball of green flames and a crimson flying sword shot forth in unison, and the green flames transformed into a huge menacing ghostly head that pounced directly toward Han Li.

As for the flying sword, it released an extremely unsettling sharp howl and came crashing down while emitting an overwhelming odor of blood and gore.

By using the profound restriction in this place and the silver formation plate she was carrying, the devilish beauty had managed to escape the detection of Han Li's spiritual sense and spirit eyes. In the instant that the two extreme mountains and the Purple-striped Gold Devouring Beetles left Han Li, she immediately appeared alongside another Body Integration Stage puppet to unleash a devastating sneak attack.

She was unleashing all of her most powerful abilities at once to kill Han Li on the spot. In the face of this unexpected and extremely fierce attack, even Han Li's pupils contracted drastically, but he immediately reacted and sprang into action.

Golden light flashed from his body, and he transformed into his Giant Mountain Ape for again. With the incredible strength that this form bestowed upon him, he was able to escape the restrictions being exerted upon him by the runes both above and below him, and his magic power also became free to circulate again.

After letting loose a loud roar, black Qi swirled around Han Li's upper body, and his suit of Heavenly Devilish Armor appeared before releasing countless black runes in a frenzy to form a protective barrier.

At the same time, golden light flashed behind him, and a golden body with three heads and six arms emerged. The golden body swung all six of its arms through the air, and six giant golden blades appeared at once to oppose the oncoming giant transparent sword.

As all this was happening, a green figure also shot forth out of Han Li's body before transforming into another green-skinned Han Li.

The green-skinned Han Li clenched its fists and unleashed countless green fist projections that hurtled directly toward the ghostly head and the crimson sword Qi.

As for Han Li himself, he opened his cavernous mouth to release a ball of silver flames.

In the next instant, lights of all colors exploded around Han Li, creating an extremely dazzling display to behold.

Powerful shockwaves surged forth in all directions like gale-force winds, threatening to engulf everything in the surrounding area.

All of a sudden, an anguished cry rang out, and a humanoid figure stumbled out of thin air. There was blood all over her body, and one of her arms was completely missing.

This was none other than the devilish beauty, but the sinister look on her face had now been replaced with one of incredulity.

A cold harrumph rang out, and the giant golden ape appeared alongside the green-skinned Han Li in the distance amid a flash of spiritual light.

The giant ape was holding a ball of green flames in one hand, and a purple blade segment in its other hand.

Within the green flames, a green skull was struggling with all its might while expelling black Qi out of its mouth, trying to escape from the golden ape, but the Giant Mountain Ape was far too strong and refused to let the green skull slip out of its grasp.

Meanwhile, the purple blade segment was radiating five-colored light, and there was a hint of the power of laws of heaven and earth emanating from it.

As for the green-skinned Han Li, the flesh on one of its arms had been completely stripped away to reveal the bone underneath, while its other arm was entirely charred black, as if it had just been incinerated by some kind of devilish flame.

Not far away from the two of them, a shimmering golden figure was engaged in a fierce battle against the transparent puppet!

"That's a Profound Heavenly Treasure and a golden body!" the devilish beauty exclaimed in a shrill voice, as if there were a hand closed around her throat.

She then immediately flipped her remaining hand over to produce a silver formation plate, then hurriedly waved it through the air with a horrified look on her face.

Faint golden light appeared around her, and her body immediately became blurry and indistinct, looking as if she were about to vanish in an instant.

Han Li immediately summoned his Law Destruction Eye again upon seeing this, then blasted forth a pillar of black light.

The pillar of light vanished into space almost at the exact same time as the devilish beauty did, and a dull thump rang out several hundred feet away, following which the devilish beauty stumbled out of thin air in a panicked manner.

Before she even had a chance to regain her bearings, she was greeted by a cold harrumph from the golden ape, and a burst of sharp excruciating pain immediately speared through her spiritual sense, causing her to plummet out of the sky.

Almost at the exact same moment, the giant ape sprang forward and transformed into a giant bird amid a flash of silver lightning. A second pair of translucent azure wings then appeared on the bird's back, and it flapped all four of its wings in unison, upon which it abruptly vanished on the spot.

A rumbling thunderclap then rang out right behind the devilish beauty, and a giant silver talon suddenly emerged before impaling her body without any warning.

A burst of silver flames was then released by the talon, and the fire quickly encompassed her entire body, reducing her to ashes, as well as incinerating her Nascent Soul into nothingness.

After that, the giant bird quickly shrank down and reverted back to its human form.

Han Li then turned toward the Provenance Golden Body, which was still locked in combat against the transparent puppet, and he flicked his fingers toward the distance.

A series of streaks of sword Qi sprang forth, and all of them were hurtling toward the exact spot that the puppet was retreating toward.

The puppet was clearly far more suited to assassinations and sneak attacks rather than direct battles, and it was quickly forced onto the back foot.

Finally, it was overwhelmed, and shredded into countless pieces by the giant golden blades being wielded by the golden body.

Meanwhile, the two rainbow puppets in the distance were also in a very perilous situation.

The giant azure sword that Han Li had directed toward the light barrier had failed to do anything as he had been distracted by that sneak attack just now, but with the 13 Purple-striped Gold Devouring Beetles devouring spiritual power to their hearts' content, the barrier still collapsed in the end.
