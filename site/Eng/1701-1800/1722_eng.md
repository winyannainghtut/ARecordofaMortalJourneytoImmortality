A faint smile appeared on Liu Shui'er's face upon seeing this, and she also waved a hand through the air to release a green bracelet . The bracelet emitted a ringing sound before immediately flying toward the other side of the palace as a ball of green light .

The green light flashed and also swept up the weapons and armor on that side of the palace, thereby leaving the entire place completely empty aside from that screen .

The two of them then quickly searched through the palace with their spiritual sense, and after failing to discover anything, they immediately made their way out of the palace .

To them, it may have been a blessing for Han Li to have entered that alternate space . After all, there may not actually be any treasures in there, and he could be temporarily trapped by some kind of restriction in there .

Without Han Li there to compete with them, they would definitely reap bountiful rewards from the side palaces and that huge cluster of pavilions, and with that in mind, Shi Kun was feeling a lot better about the situation .

Thus, after a brief discussion with Liu Shui'er outside the palace, the two of them separated and each traveled toward a different side palace .

Within the nameless space inside the screen .

Han Li had already made his way over to the giant gate, and he raised both of his hands, releasing a burst of five-colored glacial flames and a burst of grey light, both of which were surging relentlessly into the huge gate .

The golden and silver runes on the gate had already transformed into a vast expanse of vibrant light that was firmly opposing Han Li's attacks, and the layers of light were quickly being melted away by the glacial flames and grey light, but there seemed to be no end to the runes, which simply replenished the defenses .

As such, even after unleashing these two abilities on the gate for a long while, they did nothing to whittle away at the restriction .

Han Li's brows furrowed tightly upon seeing this, and the spiritual light faded from his hands as he ceased what he was doing . He then rubbed his hands together before thrusting them forward, and two golden arcs of lightning that were as thick as large bowls immediately sprang forth before striking the light on the gate in a flash .

An earth-shattering boom rang out as the golden arcs of lightning completely exploded, releasing a ball of dazzling electricity that inundated most of the massive gate . However, moments later, the golden lightning faded, and the gate was revealed to be completely unscathed .

Even such a powerful attack hadn't affected it at all .

Han Li's expression darkened upon seeing this . Prior to entering this place, his Law Destruction Eye had suddenly become extremely active right as he walked around to the back of the screen, and he had almost lost control over it .

If that hadn't been the case, it would've been very difficult for him to notice the entrance of the spatial restriction on the screen .

At the time, he had gone with the flow and unleashed an attack toward the screen with his Law Destruction Eye, and it really had broken the restriction, thereby allowing him to access this place with ease .

He didn't know what kind of place this was, nor did he know whether there were any treasures beyond that gate, but just this world within the screen was an extremely rare treasure in the Spirit Realm, so it was presumably the case that the immortal owner of this place was concealing some kind of extraordinary item or secret in here .

As such, even though he knew that this restriction was quite remarkable, and that Liu Shui'er and Shi Kun were most likely going to take advantage of his absence to loot the rest of this place, he still didn't want to leave .

However, the fact that his Divine Essencefused Light, Divine Devilbane Lightning, and five-colored glacial flames had all proven to be ineffective on this restriction posed quite a troublesome conundrum to him .

After a brief moment of contemplation, he opened his mouth to expel a ball of silver flames . The fireball then transformed into the Spirit Engulfing Fire Raven amid a flash of silver light, and Han Li made a hand seal before casting a dozen or so incantation seals toward the Fire Raven in quick succession .

Spiritual light of different colors flashed from the incantation seals, and they all vanished into the Fire Raven's body .

The bird immediately raised his head and let loose a clear cry before swelling drastically to around 10 feet in size .

It then spread its wings and flew toward the gate with unstoppable might .

Prior to actually crashing into the gate, silver light flashed from its body, and countless translucent flaming feathers hurtled forth, causing the golden and silver light on the surface of the huge gate to tremor violently .

The giant silver bird then crashed headfirst into the light amid a resounding boom, and scorching silver flames erupted from its body .

As soon as the golden and silver light came into contact with the silver flames, it began to churn like boiling water .

The light faded and melted in the wake of the flames, and even though there was still a constant output of runes from the gate, it was clearly struggling to keep up .

A hint of elation appeared on Han Li's face upon seeing this . He let loose a low cry, and black light swirled around his body, following which he expanded drastically to several times his original size . At the same time, a layer of long golden fur appeared all over his body, and he transformed into a giant golden ape .

It was none other than the Giant Golden Ape form that Han Li had adopted once not long ago .

He flipped a hand over, and the Extreme Essencefused Mountain appeared over one of his furry palms .

Blue light flashed through the giant ape's eyes, and it swung an arm through the air, sending the mountain hurtling the mountain through the air amid a resounding boom .

Gusts of gale-force winds instantly took shape in the wake of the small mountain, and one could only imagine the devastating force culminating from the Extreme Essencefused Mountain's enormous weight and the giant ape's extraordinary strength .

The thin layer of light was instantly torn apart by the small mountain before it crashed heavily into the massive door amid an earth-shattering boom .

A ball of black light erupted from the gate, and the surrounding space twisted and warped white ripples that were visible to the naked eye surged through the air .

The ripples were then devoured by the black light behind them before completely vanishing into the darkness . Even with Han Li's immense powers, his heart still jolted upon seeing this, and he hurriedly rushed backward in an alarmed manner .

Black Qi rose up around his body, and he immediately donned his suit of Heavenly Devilish Armor .

The black light finally faded, and Han Li waved a hand through the air to draw the Extreme Essencefused Mountain back to him . He then hurriedly narrowed his eyes and cast his gaze toward the gate up ahead, upon which a stunned look appeared on his face .

At the center of the giant black gate was an indentation that resembled a pot and was around 10 feet deep . The shape of the indentation was completely identical to one corner of the Extreme Essencefused Mountain, but despite this, the gate still hadn't been completely destroyed .

Furthermore, it was slowly recovering back to its original form amid flashes of light from the golden and silver runes .

Han Li didn't know what material this gate had been forged from, but it was extremely resilient! It appeared that there was only one more thing that he could try .

He heaved a faint sigh as a wry smile appeared on his face, but he didn't hesitate any longer as black light flashed, and he reverted back to his human form . Immediately thereafter, he made a hand seal, and bright golden light erupted from his body .

A series of golden scales appeared over his skin, and his face was also concealed by a layer of golden light . He laid a hand onto the back of his own head, and a golden projection with three heads and six arms suddenly appeared .

The projection's six arms made hand seals in unison, and brilliant golden light erupted from it as it manifested a substantial golden body .

In the next instant, one of the golden body's arms abruptly reached out and made a grabbing motion, upon which a golden blade segment suddenly appeared in its hand .

This was none other than the incomplete Profound Heavenly Treasure!

Han Li began to chant something, and light swirled around the golden body, forming countless runes that surged into the blade segment in a frenzy .

Golden light flashed from the surface of the blade segment, and it blurred slightly before the rest of the blade was also conjured up . Initially, this segment of the blade was slightly blurry and indistinct, but with the influx of more golden runes, it quickly became identical to the rest of the blade .

The blade tremored slightly as the golden body brandished it, and a wave of golden light instantly erupted from it .

The nearby world's origin Qi in the wake of the golden light was immediately stirred up into a frenzied state, and countless specks of five-colored light instantly appeared out of thin air before surging rapidly toward the golden blade like moths to a flame, then vanishing into the blade itself .

A delightful ringing sound rang out from the golden blade, and Han Li's chanting abruptly ceased before he uttered a single menacing word, "Slash!"

The golden body immediately raised the golden blade before slashing it toward the giant gate at Han Li's behest, sending a scintillating blade projection hurtling through the air .

Initially, the blade projection was only around a foot in length, but after flying through the air for several tens of feet, it had swelled to around 10 feet in length before striking the huge black gate like a dreamy golden crescent moon .

The seemingly indestructible gate was sliced in half by the blade projection in a completely soundless manner before collapsing inward .

Han Li was ecstatic to see this, and he immediately withdrew his golden body projection before rushing forward, leaving a trail of afterimages in his wake .

In the blink of an eye, Han Li had passed through the broken gate, and as soon as he emerged on the other side, he began to inspect his surroundings while simultaneously releasing his enormous spiritual sense .

Immediately thereafter, a stunned look appeared on his face . The world beyond the gate consisted of a small plaza with grey barriers all around it and azure light shimmering above it .

Aside from the giant gate that he had just passed through, there were no other visible entrances, and the entire plaza was completely empty aside from a strange circular platform at its center, upon which something seemed to have been placed .

Han Li withdrew his spiritual sense, and his pupils contracted slightly at the sight of the tall platform before he made his way directly toward it .

Moments later, he arrived near the platform, and he discovered that it was only just over 300 feet in size .

There were intricate and beautiful designs carved onto the ground, depicting the sun, the moon, and stars of different sizes . All of the depictions were extremely life-like, and they covered virtually the entire platform .

At the center of the platform was a vibrant green taishi chair that was quite grandiose to behold . Aside from that, there were nine silver objects that were each around as tall as a human . They were standing on the platform in a completely stationary manner, and Han Li discovered that these were silver armored warriors that were wielding long halberds .

Aside from nine pairs of black eyes, none of the armored warriors had any parts of their bodies revealed through their suits of armor . These appeared to be statues or other types of inanimate objects rather than sentient puppets . However, all of them were in a rather strange position .

They weren't wielding their halberds with both hands . Instead, one hand was making a hand seal while the other hand was locked tightly around the shaft of the halberd at around the halfway point, while the sharp tip of the weapon was pointed directly up the sky .

All nine of the silver armored puppets were in the same pose .
