Han Li raised an eyebrow upon seeing this before extending a pristine white hand out of his sleeve. Five white skull projections instantly shot forth from his fingertips before expanding to the size of wagon wheels.

These were none other than the Unbroken Cinque Devils that Han Li had refined to become a part of his hand, and they cackled in a sinister manner as they expelled bursts of five-colored flames out of their mouths.

With the current powers of the five devils, they were no longer able to provide much assistance to Han Li, which was why he very rarely summoned them in battle after entering the Spirit Realm. However, after Han Li absorbed that type of glacial power that he stumbled upon in the primordial world, the five devils had become a lot more powerful than before.

They were still extremely vulnerable against attacks from high-grade cultivators, but the new glacial flames they were able to expel were incredibly powerful.

Under normal circumstances, Han Li was able to borrow the power of the five devils to unleash a fraction of the glacial flames' powers, so he wouldn't need to summon the five devils. However, the glacial powers that Fei Ya was displaying were the most powerful that he had ever seen, so he decided to summon the five devils as well.

In the face of the new five-colored glacial flames being expelled by the giant skulls, the glacial power in the surrounding air was significantly nullified, and the sword formation was able to function as normal again.

Han Li's glacial flames were slightly inferior in power to Fei Ya's glacial powers, but they were still capable of absorbing part of his glacial powers.

Han Li quickly made a hand seal, and countless streaks of azure sword Qi immediately emerged within the sword formation, then converged to form a massive ball of light at the center of the formation.

A thunderous dragon's roar erupted from the ball of light, and it shattered to reveal an azure coiled dragon.

The coiled dragon had azure scales all over its body, and every single one of those scales was as bright and smooth as a mirror. It was giving off an extremely fearsome aura that threatened to destroy heaven and earth, and it pounced directly toward the oncoming giant flying blade.

An earth-shattering boom rang out as the giant blade clashed with the azure dragon, and the glacial power being released by the blade became even more potent amid a flash of scintillating white light.

However, upon striking the coiled dragon's neck, a metallic clang rang out, and the blade was repelled while the dragon remained completely unscathed.

As a result of the clash, a thick layer of ice immediately appeared over the upper half of the dragon's body, but it merely shook its body, and ice instantly cracked.

It then let loose a roar of fury before biting down upon the giant blade and also extended its claws toward the blade in a menacing manner.

The massive blade possessed formidable power, but it wasn't actually all that resolute. Upon being attacked by the coiled dragon, a string of loud cracks rang out, and the entire blade was quickly shattered before disintegrating into countless specks of translucent light.

A surprised expression finally appeared on Fei Ya's face upon seeing this, but he merely pointed a finger up ahead, and several tens of unharmed translucent flying daggers reappeared amid a gust of glacial wind.

Han Li's expression changed slightly upon seeing this. Only now did it become clear to him that these flying daggers weren't actually treasures; they had been manifested from Fei Ya's glacial powers instead.

As such, as long as Fei Ya still had sufficient magic power, he would be able to recreate these blades indefinitely. This was truly a surprise to Han Li. However, that didn't stop him from instructing the azure coiled dragon to pounce directly toward Fei Ya.

At the same time, a thunderclap erupted behind him, and a pair of translucent wings appeared on his back. A cold light flashed through his eyes, and he vanished on the spot amid a flash of lightning.

The more fearsome his opponent was, the greater the necessity for Han Li to kill him as quickly as possible. This was the best course of action for both himself and the entire human army in Heavenlean City.

Fei Ya's pupils contracted slightly upon seeing this, but he then harrumphed coldly, and the translucent flying daggers hovering before him shot forth high up into the air. The daggers converged up above to form the same translucent giant blade, while Fei Ya stomped a foot into the air and shot forth as a streak of translucent light.

The streak of light then fused as one with the massive blade, and it slashed toward the azure coiled dragon in a vicious manner.

This giant blade was almost twice as powerful as the previous one, and before it had even made contact with the coiled dragon, the entire surrounding air had already been filled with glacial light.

However, the azure dragon wasn't fearful in the slightest upon seeing this. The scales all over its body stood up on end, and it transformed into a vast expanse of azure light that clashed with the giant blade.

Glacial light and azure light intertwined as they clashed in a ferocious manner, and the two seemed to be evenly matched.

Right at this moment, silver lightning flashed, and Han Li appeared up above before immediately grabbing downward with both hands.

Two giant hands that were each several tens of feet in size emerged out of thin. One of them was as pristine white as jade with layers of five-colored glacial flames around it, while the other was as black as ink and was enveloped in a layer of silver flames.

The two giant hands thrust downward, and glacial and scorching powers intertwined, creating a strange combination that enhanced rather than weakened one another.

Glacial light flashed down below, and Fei Ya emerged before transforming into a giant frosty hand that rose up into the air.

This hand was as translucent as ice, and the entire surrounding space congealed in the face of its glacial powers.

The three massive hands clashed violently, and the five-colored flames around the giant white hand were immediately snuffed out, following which the hand itself was shattered.

However, the glacial power emanating from the giant frosty hand was also nullified somewhat, and it shrank slightly in size.

After that, the inky-black hand clashed with the glacial hand, and the Spirit Engulfing Heavenly Flames immediately enveloped the giant frosty hand. Not only was all of its glacial power nullified, the frosty hand began to melt at a rate that was discernible to the naked eye.

Right before all of the glacial power was depleted, a burst of glacial light shot forth out of the silver flames before flying away like lightning.

However, it was followed by a thin golden and silver thread that vanished into the glacial light in a flash.

A cry of shock and fury rang out from within the glacial light, and Fei Ya stumbled out of it with a hand clasped over his chest.

Through the gaps between his fingers, a purplish-black wound could be seen, and he had a look of astonishment and rage in his eyes.

The wound had been inflicted by the Revolving Evil Spirit Light that the Spirit Engulfing Heavenly Flames had devoured in the past, and Fei Ya had been caught completely off guard by the attack.

Han Li chuckled coldly as a layer of black Qi quickly surged throughout Fei Ya's body, and he knew that even if the poison within the Revolving Evil Spirit Light wouldn't be able to kill him, it would definitely have at least weakened him significantly, thereby making him a lot more vulnerable.

He quickly cast a glance toward Fairy Yu to find that she was engaged in a fierce battle against Fairy Silver Light and his silver ruler, so there was no way she would be able to intervene to assist Fei Ya.

As such, Han Li didn't hesitate any longer as he flapped his wings, and he immediately pounced toward Fei Ya amid a rumbling thunderclap.

However, right at this moment, spatial fluctuations suddenly erupted in the air above the battlefield, and the entire sky abruptly dimmed. Immediately thereafter, an inky-black vortex that was around an acre in size emerged hundreds of thousands of feet up in the air. An extremely terrifying aura seeped out of the vortex, and the aura was only growing more powerful at an incredible rate.

Han Li immediately stopped cold in his tracks and cast his gaze toward the vortex with a stunned expression.

This aura was rather familiar to him; it was identical to the one released by the spiritual sense that had communicated with him in the giant pagoda. However, this aura was even more fearsome than the one that had appeared in the pagoda.

What was even more alarming to him was that there was a humanoid figure standing right under the massive vortex, and upon closer inspection, Han Li discovered that it was none other than the silver-robed middle-aged man, the male half of the Yin Yang Twin Devils.

Both the human and devilish beings on the battlefield were stunned to see this.

Many of them stopped what they were doing and turned to stare up at the massive vortex with shock and awe in their eyes.

Han Li's expression darkened significantly, and before he had made up his mind about whether he should focus on killing Fei Ya or make a detour to destroy the vortex first, the silver-robed middle-aged man suddenly made a hand seal before opening his mouth to expel a crimson ruby-like crystal.

All of a sudden, the terrifying aura emanating from the vortex abruptly vanished, but in the next instant, a burst of blackish-red devilish Qi flew out of the vortex before vanishing into the crystal in a flash.

Crimson light flashed from the surface of the crystal, and it was suddenly drawn back into the silver-robed man's body.

In the next instant, crimson light erupted from the silver-robed man's body, and he threw his hands onto his head as he let loose a howl of excruciating agony. At the same time, a string of loud cracks and pops rang out from all over his body, and his face and aura underwent an astonishing transformation.
