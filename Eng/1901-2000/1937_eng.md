Han Li was struck by a sense of foreboding upon seeing this, and the 13 Purple-striped Gold Devouring Beetles that were revolving above his head instantly shot forth as balls of purple light at his behest.

Meanwhile, Han Li himself stomped a foot onto space, and he pounced through the air as a gust of fierce winds while unleashing a torrential flurry of golden fist projections.

However, regardless of whether it was the Purple-striped Gold Devouring Beetles or the fist projections, both were instantly repelled as soon as they came into contact with the rainbow halos.

At this moment, the power of laws in the nearby area became even more pronounced. The dazzling light that was being released by the rainbow halos illuminated the entire sky, striking the beholder with an extremely unsettling sensation.

A cold light flashed through Han Li's eyes upon seeing this, and as he continued to hurtle through the air, he let loose a ferocious roar, and his body began to expand at an incredible rate.

Within mere moments, he had swelled to around 4,000 to 5,000 feet tall, and he took in a massive lungful of air before expelling a wave of white Qi.

Initially, the wave of Qi was completely silent, but after traveling for around 100 feet, an earth-shattering boom suddenly erupted from it.

The three clones felt as if an explosive thunderclap had erupted right beside their ears, and they swayed unsteadily as their bodies shuddered.

The space in the wake of the white wave began to turn murky and indistinct, and there were even some sections that were twisting and warping, as if the entire space were about to collapse.

This was the Golden Net Roar, a new Giant Mountain Ape ability that Han Li had mastered after progressing to the mid-Body Integration Stage.

This was a purely soundwave-based cultivation art, and it was incredibly powerful. When unleashed to its full extent, it was capable of even shattering space itself.

This was another countermeasure that Han Li had prepared against the Rainbow Light Pagoda, and in this perilous situation, he immediately chose to unleash the technique.

The white soundwaves and rainbow light clashed, and the former instantly vanished soundlessly into the latter.

A loud buzzing sound then rang out from the rainbow light, and the golden runes hovering within the light disintegrated in a flash. The golden light itself also began to flash erratically, as if it were about to shatter at any moment.

The clone that had just returned to his senses from the soundwave attack hurriedly made a hand seal upon seeing this to control the small pagoda again, but he had fallen a step behind Han Li.

All of a sudden, countless silver runes appeared over the Provenance Golden Body at Han Li's behest, giving it a very mystical appearance. The giant grey python pounced viciously toward it, but it abruptly vanished like a gentle breeze.

Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang faltered slightly upon seeing this, but just as he was about to rush over to the massive python and unleash some kind of powerful ability to take care of the golden body, a buzzing sound suddenly rang out, and his heart stirred as he hurriedly cast his gaze toward the direction the sound was coming from.

There, he discovered 13 huge beetles flying directly toward him while opening their mouths to expel plumes of purple threads. These spirit insects had been instructed by Han Li to sneak over to Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang, who immediately swept a hand toward them without any hesitation.

The sea of blood down below howled as a massive wave rose up right in front of Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang. However, the huge wave only managed to stop a small proportion of the purple threads expelled by the beetles, while the majority of the threads pierced directly through to the other side, then reached Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang in the blink of an eye.

Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang's expression darkened upon seeing this, and the eight azure ghostly heads hanging around his neck suddenly sprang forth amid a sharp cry. They then rotated in mid-air to form a huge azure ring with the eight ghostly heads facing outward, connected by an azure halo.

In the face of the oncoming purple threads, the two ghostly heads facing that direction instantly expelled countless silver stars.

As the two clashed, the purple threads were swept up and drawn into the ghostly heads by the silver stars. On top of that, the other six ghostly heads were expelling countless blades of wind out of their mouths.

Each blade was only around the size of a human hand, but they were remarkably dense, and they seemed to pierce directly through space before instantly striking the Purple-striped Gold Devouring Beetles.

A rapid string of crisp clangs rang out, and all of the blades of wind were repelled, while the beetles remained completely unscathed.

Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang was rather stunned to see this, but he didn't falter in the slightest as he raised a hand to cast several incantation seals in succession toward the massive azure ring.

The eight ghostly heads screeched in unison, and a crimson projection erupted out of each of the heads before plunging into the swarm of Purple-striped Gold Devouring Beetles after just a few flashes.

These were eight nude crimson ghosts with massive horns on their heads. They had green eyes and extremely sharp fingers. As they swept their arms through the air, bursts of crimson mist swept forth alongside countless claw projection, and they clashed in a ferocious manner with the beetles.

During this time that Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang was being distracted by the Purple-striped Gold Devouring Beetles, golden light flashed from behind Han Li, and the Provenance Golden Body re-emerged.

Immediately thereafter, the golden body flew forward and fused as one with Han Li. Golden light swirled all over Han Li's body, and several grotesque bulges appeared below his ribs before two more pairs of giant furry arms suddenly emerged. At the same time, golden light flashed from his shoulders, and two more heads appeared, both of which were slightly smaller than the original one.

Thus, the Giant Mountain Ape had taken on a form with three heads and six arms!

As soon as Han Li completed his transformation, he spread his fingers and made a grabbing motion toward the small pagoda.

Faint golden light flashed from his palms, following which a mysterious silver rune appeared over each of his hands, then transformed into projections that descended from above.

The nearby world's origin Qi immediately began to flood toward the projections in a frenzy, and six bursts of mountainous force came crashing down from the heavens.

In the face of these six bursts of tremendous force, the rainbow light began to tremor violently, then warped and elongated like a piece of dough before completely crumbling away amid a dull thump.

The clone that was controlling the pagoda was very alarmed to see this, and he immediately bit through the tip of his own tongue before expelling a ball of blood essence toward the pagoda. The ball of blood essence exploded into a cloud of blood mist that enshrouded the entire pagoda, and a layer of translucent light instantly appeared over its surface.

Furthermore, it was releasing a pagoda projection that seemed to be about to fly up into the heavens.

However, right at this moment, Han Li suddenly let loose a loud cry before tightly clenching the fingers on his six hands.

The mountainous force descending from above abruptly transformed into suction power, and the small pagoda was drawn involuntarily toward Han Li.

The clone let loose a cry of surprise upon seeing this, and he immediately shot forth as a streak of crimson light before vanishing into the pagoda in a flash. As a result, the pagoda was instantly stabilized, but a cold smile suddenly appeared on Han Li's face as he abruptly thrust his fists downward.

In contrast with his last attack, this one was completely silent, but spatial fluctuations suddenly erupted around the small rainbow pagoda, and the air became extremely viscous.

A burst of invisible power had completely restricted the area around the pagoda, following which Han Li rubbed his hands together without any hesitation before sweeping them downward.

A rumbling thunderclap rang out, and countless golden arcs of lightning erupted from his huge furry hands. The arcs of lightning intertwined to form a giant golden net that was around 1,000 feet in size, but it vanished into thin air as soon as it appeared.

In the next instant, a thunderclap erupted near the rainbow pagoda, and the golden lightning net emerged in a flash with the pagoda right at its center.

Han Li quickly made a hand seal, and the lightning net rapidly converged toward the small pagoda amid a flash of golden light.

A massive golden ball instantly took shape, and the pagoda was trapped firmly within it.

At the same time, spatial fluctuations erupted, and the spirit body transformed into a faint green shadow before appearing beside the golden ball, then flicked its fingers toward it in quick succession.

A plume of green threads shot forth through the air, creating another layer of green threads around the golden ball, thereby instantly turning it green.

In the air above, Han Li thrust his six hands down toward the golden ball in rapid succession, and countless runes emerged from his massive palms before flooding into the giant ball.

A series of intricate and colorful formations instantly emerged on the surface of the golden ball as a result.

"Hmph! Do you really think these little tricks of yours can trap me?" An enraged voice rang out from within the ball.

As soon as the voice trailed off, bursts of rumbling rang out from within the ball, and the runes on its surface began to flash erratically. At the same time, it was also bulging and collapsing in different areas in an extremely unstable manner.

The outermost layer of green threads immediately began to crack, and it seemed that it would crumble away at any moment.

Han Li was quite stunned to see this, and he knew that he had still underestimated the power of the Rainbow Light Pagoda. Even after implementing such a careful plan, he was still unable to truly trap it.

However, the surprise on his face only appeared for an instant before it faded. He had prepared several courses of action that he could use against this treasure; seeing as the first plan had failed, he would just have to resort to his backup plans.

With that in mind, Han Li let loose a low roar as he made a grabbing motion downward with his six hands in unison, then abruptly swung his arms up into the air.

The green ball was immediately elevated by over 10,000 feet by a burst of invisible force.

Right at this moment, a faint green shadow flashed in the air above the ball; the spirit body had already arrived there in advance, and it suddenly tossed an object toward the ball with a solemn look on its face.
