Not only were these tentacles covered in dark green patterns, they were also riddled with massive suction cups the size of wagon wheels, creating a truly disturbing sight .

As soon as these tentacles emerged, Shi Kun stomped a foot into the ground, and his body shot forth like an arrow, taking him to the nearest tentacle in a flash before he swiped an arm through the air .

A streak of yellow light hurtled forth like a giant blade that was over 100 feet long, slicing through one of the massive tentacles with ease .

A massive fountain of green blood immediately spurted into the air, and rank green blood began to rain down from the sky .

Shi Kun let loose a burst of raucous laughter upon seeing this, and his body swayed as he prepared to fly toward another tentacle .

However, a thunderous roar suddenly erupted from below the island, causing the entire sky in the nearby area to tremor audibly .

Shi Kun faltered in mid-air as his expression changed slightly, and right at this moment, the sea beast's severed tentacle suddenly whipped violently through the air .

The bleeding from the wound immediately ceased, and bursts of putrid green mist were blasted forth from within .

Shi Kun was clearly an extremely experienced warrior, and he immediately retreated upon seeing this, flying back to over 300 feet away to distance himself from this green mist .

However, as opposed to attacking Shi Kun, the green mist in the air suddenly manifested into a complete tentacle that was identical to one he had just severed .

Shi Kun's expression darkened upon seeing this, and he immediately swiped his arm through the air again to unleash another devastating streak of yellow light .

However, on this occasion, all of the suction cups on the newly formed tentacle immediately compressed before expanding to expel bursts of black light .

The yellow streak of light struck the black light with a loud clang, followed by the sharp screeching sound of metal grating on metal . The yellow streak of light was able to slice through part of the black light, but it finally fizzled out into nothingness just before it could reach the sea beast's tentacle .

At this moment, the roar erupting from below the island became even louder, and the tentacle came crashing down toward Shi Kun with mountainous force .

Before it had even struck him, fierce gusts of wind were swept up, making it quite difficult for Shi Kun to stand still on the spot .

A ferocious look appeared on his face, and he let loose a loud roar as he launched a fist into the air .

Han Li and Liu Shui'er were both spectating the battle intently from above, and they noticed that in the instant Shi Kun unleashed that punch, his fist swelled up like a balloon to five to six times its original size .

Furthermore, several yellow runes emerged from the giant fist before exploding in unison, and a yellow halo swept forth, forming shockwave-like ripples of light .

As soon as the giant tentacle came into contact with the yellow light, its skin was twisted and warped as if it had been stirred up by some kind of immense force . Immediately thereafter, the tentacle began to essentially disintegrate as it fell from above as chunks of skin and flesh, along with gushing green blood .

This punch seemed to be even more powerful than the one Shi Kun had unleashed to flatten the entire small island .

Even Han Li's eyelids twitched involuntarily upon seeing this .

However, the sea beast below the island had clearly been completely enraged by this attack, and it let loose a violent roar as its remaining few tentacles whipped through the air in unison, forming countless black shadows that crashed directly toward Shi Kun .

These tentacles were so massive that they were sweeping up a hurricane that encompassed the entire island .

Black shadows and gale-force winds intertwined, completely inundating Shi Kun in the process .

"Looks like we won't need to do anything; Fellow Daoist Shi should be enough to take care of this sea beast on his own," Liu Shui'er sighed as she looked on from above .

"Indeed . Brother Shi possesses an extremely powerful body, so this sea beast will inevitably be killed eventually . However, this thing seems to possess an immortal body ability, so it's best that we enter the ocean and kill its main body first . After all, it won't be a good thing to have this battle drag on for too long," Han Li replied after a brief pause .

"That's true . I just so happen to be using a water-attribute cultivation art, so I'll take care of this," Liu Shui'er replied with a nod .

Han Li was rather surprised to hear this, but he merely smiled, and agreed, "In that case, I'll leave everything to you, Fairy Liu . "

Thus, Liu Shui'er made a hand seal, and blue light flashed from her body as she sped directly downward as a streak of blue light, vanishing into the ocean after just a few flashes .

Almost at the exact same moment, a string of resounding booms rang out from the small island, which had been entirely enshrouded under fierce winds and black shadows .

Han Li cast his gaze toward the island to discover balls of piercing yellow light forcibly tearing their way through the powerful winds . At the same time, an astonishingly scorching aura erupted into the heavens, causing even the two restriction barriers up above to tremor slightly .

Amid these resounding booms, Shi Kun's raucous laughter was still clearly audible, and he seemed to have only just gotten warmed up .

"Is he a berserker? I'd only ever heard of such beings in the past, but I appear to be witnessing one in action right now," Han Li murmured to himself with a wry smile on his face while sweeping a sleeve through the air .

A burst of azure light swept forth, disappearing into the white light barrier in a flash, and the restriction barrier fell completely still again .

Thus, Shi Kun continued in his rampage on the small island, constantly pulverizing the tentacles around him, while the tentacles of the sea beast quickly regenerated amid a burst of green mist .

Thus, the two of them came to an impasse of sorts .

However, moments later, the beastly roars erupting from below the island suddenly took an anguished turn, and the seawater down below began to churn violently . A massive wave that was over 1,000 feet tall was swept up without any premonition before hurtling toward the small island with devastating might .

If such an astonishingly powerful wave really were to strike the island, there was a good chance that it would sink .

Han Li's expression darkened slightly as he looked on from above, and he immediately extended a pristine white palm of his sleeve, then spread his fingers open before making a grabbing motion .

Five bursts of five-colored glacial flames immediately erupted from his fingertips, injecting themselves into the white light barrier encompassing the island in a flash .

The light barrier immediately took on the five colors of the glacial flames, and at this moment, the giant wave crashed down upon it .

The five-colored light barrier appeared to be extremely thin and fragile, but as five-colored light swept over its surface, all of the seawater was instantly frozen into glacial ice .

Thus, a peculiar scene ensued .

A massive dome of blue ice appeared over the island, keeping all of the oncoming waves of seawater at bay while the small island itself remained completely unscathed .

Han Li nodded with a pleased expression upon seeing this before withdrawing his hand .

The giant waves only crashed into the wall of ice a few times before they subsided, and the entire surface of the ocean suddenly became remarkably calm .

Just as a contemplative expression had appeared on Han Li's face, a resounding boom rang out as a humanoid figure flew up from the island, then appeared in mid-air .

"What happened? Why isn't that sea beast attacking anymore? Could it be that Fellow Daoist Liu decided to lend me a hand?"

The humanoid figure was naturally none other than Shi Kun, and he was looking at Han Li with a hint of confusion in his eyes .

Han Li smiled upon hearing this, yet just as he was about to say something, a massive black vortex suddenly appeared on the surface of the ocean beside the island . The seawater nearby revolved around the vortex as the mountainous body of a black beast rose to the surface, revealing itself to be a gargantuan black octopus .

However, not only was this octopus extraordinarily huge, it also possessed the face of a ferocious-looking human male .

There were even two thick arms attached to its body alongside the giant tentacles, and attached to each of those arms was a hand that was wielding a crimson spear-like weapon .

A burst of blue light shot forth out of the water from beside the giant sea beast's carcass, then abruptly appeared in the air beside Han Li .

The blue light faded, and Liu Shui'er's gorgeous figure was revealed .

"So it really was you, Fairy Liu . Tsk tsk, you must have some tricks up your sleeve to be able to take care of this giant beast so quickly," Shi Kun said with a hint of surprise in his eyes .

"It wasn't much . If it weren't for the fact that you'd attracted most of the beast's attention, I wouldn't have been able to kill it anywhere near as easily . I must say, you're abilities are quite impressive, Fellow Daoist Han; you've even managed to freeze such a vast quantity of seawater," Liu Shui'er remarked as she took a glance at the massive dome of ice down below .

"Hehe, there's no need for you two to be so modest . Seeing as the beast has been slain, let's withdraw these restrictions and settle on the island," Han Li chuckled .

Shi Kun and Liu Shui'er naturally had no objections to this, and the former immediately began to descend toward the island .

Meanwhile, Han Li and Liu Shui'er both made hand seals to withdraw their restrictions .

"Brother Han, we can't just leave this dome of ice here; it's far too eye-catching," Liu Shui'er said as she pointed downward .

Han Li seemed to have considered this issue already, and he quickly replied, "Of course; I'll melt it right away . "

After that, he opened his mouth to expel a silver fireball, which immediately transformed into a silver Fire Raven that was around a foot in size .

"Go," Han Li instructed as he swept a sleeve toward the Fire Raven .

The Fire Raven spread its wings before diving headfirst into the dome of ice amid a clear cry .

A peculiar scene then ensued .

The dome of glacial ice that was as hard as rock began to melt away in large sections from the spot that the Fire Raven had disappeared into it, reverting back to churning seawater before raining down from above .

Within just a few minutes, the entire dome of ice had vanished .

Only then did Han Li raise a hand, and the silver Fire Raven immediately re-emerged before disappearing up his sleeve in after just a few flashes .

"You possess both fire and ice-attribute abilities? That's very rare, Fellow Daoist Han!" Liu Shui'er said with a hint of surprise in her eyes .
