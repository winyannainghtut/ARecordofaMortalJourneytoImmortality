Right at this moment, spatial fluctuations erupted over 200 feet above the flying carriage, and Han Li's trio emerged.

Han Li had managed to react in the instant before the surprise attack, and he immediately teleported the three of them out of the carriage.

Han Li was currently standing in mid-air, looking down at the lake with a grim expression.

The fact that the enemy down below had been able to conceal themselves from both him and Daoist Xie was a testament to their powers.

It was clear that a truly powerful being had tracked them down.

Right at this moment, the massive green hand exploded into countless water droplets that rained back down into the lake.

At the same time, the water in the lake churned violently, following which a hall that was around 100 feet tall emerged.

The hall was completely translucent and was glowing with faint blue light, looking as if it had been constructed purely from the water of the lake.

At the entrance of the hall stood a green-armored woman with a slightly dark complexion, and she was appraising Han Li with a cold expression.

The devilish woman was giving off the unfathomable aura of a Grand Ascension Stage being, and Han Li's expression changed drastically at the sight of her.

"Yuan Cha! Your true body has descended into the Spirit Realm?"

A cold smile appeared on the woman's face as she replied, "I didn't think that I would get to meet you so soon. You've crossed me on more than one occasion, and this is where your life ends! If you surrender yourself to me, perhaps I could consider granting you a swift and painless death, but if you resist, you'll only be setting yourself up for pain and suffering."

"Do you really think I'll fear you just because your true body is here? I've encountered multiple Sacred Ancestors recently, and none of them have been able to do anything to me," Han Li replied in a nonchalant manner.

Even though it had been a long time since Han Li had seen Yuan Cha's true body, he had been pursued by one of her clones for a very long time, so he was still able to recognize her right away.

However, he had grown far more powerful since then, and he had Daoist Xie by his side, so he wasn't overly concerned by this current situation.

Yuan Cha raised an eyebrow upon hearing this, but she continued in a completely emotionless voice, "You've met other Sacred Ancestors? So you really are the one who emerged from that spatial passageway not long ago. I'm curious, how did a mere Body Integration cultivator like you manage to survive those encounters with Sacred Ancestors? I'll admit that you're truly an exceptional talent to have progressed so rapidly in your cultivation, but this is where your cultivation journey ends."

As soon as her voice trailed off, Yuan Cha abruptly raised a hand and made a grabbing motion toward Han Li's trio.

The water in the lake down below instantly erupted upward like a reverse waterfall, then transformed into a giant green hand again.

However, this hand was over 10 times larger than the previous one, and it encompassed virtually the entire sky as it came crashing down toward Han Li's trio.

Han Li's eyes narrowed slightly upon seeing this, and he opened his mouth to expel a ball of silver flames before quickly making a hand seal.

The silver fireball instantly transformed into a silver Fire Raven that was around a foot in size, and Han Li pointed a finger toward it, upon which it rapidly swelled to the size of a small mountain as it let loose a clear cry.

Immediately thereafter, the giant Fire Raven crashed into the massive hand amid a resounding boom, and both of them exploded in unison.

Water and fire intertwined high up in the air, forming thick pillars of water and fire that rose up into the heavens before instantly evaporating into dense water vapor that permeated through the entire surrounding area.

A disdainful smile appeared on Yuan Cha's face as she uttered the word, "gather".

All of a sudden, countless specks of blue light appeared out of thin air, then entered the water vapor like droplets of rain.

The water vapor immediately converged into a white mountain that was over 10,000 feet tall, and it descended while releasing countless blue runes.

The mountain appeared to be completely weightless, but a grim look appeared on Han Li's face at the sight of it, and he immediately transformed into a giant golden ape amid a flash of golden light before lashing out with both of his fists at once.

A pair of golden fist projections was unleashed directly toward the descending mountain, and the blue runes rippled violently as if they could scatter at any moment, but the white mountain itself was completely unperturbed as it continued in its descent.

Han Li's heart jolted upon seeing this, and he immediately withdrew his fists before flipping his hands over to produce his pair of extreme mountains.

After that, he let loose a thunderous roar and hurled both of the mountains up into the air with a violent swing of his arms.

The two mountains instantly struck the underside of the blue mountain, and a burst of scintillating light erupted forth, followed by an earth-shattering boom.

At the same time, devastating energy fluctuations surged through the air in all directions, causing the entire sky to warp and twist violently.

Meanwhile, golden light flashed from Han Li's body to sweep up Zhu Guo'er, following which he strode forward and vanished into thin air in a flash.

As for Daoist Xie, he merely disappeared on the spot as a gentle breeze.

In the next instant, the devastating energy fluctuations swept through the spot where they had been standing just a moment ago.

Yuan Cha's brows furrowed slightly at the sight of the fearsome shockwaves, but she then chanted an incantation, the hall that she was situated in released a vast expanse of gentle blue light that parted the oncoming shockwaves with ease.

After the scintillating light faded, the three mountains were revealed to be locked in an impasse, with the two extreme mountains opposing the white mountain from below.

Countless shimmering blue runes were surging around the white mountain, while the black mountain was releasing waves of grey light, and the azure mountain was conjuring countless streaks of invisible sword Qi that swept through the surrounding area.

At this point, Han Li and Daoist Xie had already reappeared over 1,000 feet away.

A cold look flashed through Yuan Cha's eyes as she pointed a finger upward while uttering the word "seal".

All of the blue runes revolving around the white mountain exploded in unison, and a burst of glacial power descended from the heavens.

The two extreme mountains were instantly sealed within chunks of blue glacial ice, and Han Li drew a sharp breath upon seeing this as he immediately raised a hand to summon a ball of silver flames.

However, right as he was about to hurl the silver fireball toward the pair of extreme mountains in the distance, blue spiritual light suddenly flashed around him, and eight translucent humanoid figures emerged, all of which were identical in appearance to Yuan Cha.

However, their bodies were completely transparent, as if they were ice statues, and they pounced toward Han Li and Daoist Xie in unison.

Zhu Guo'er wasn't perceived as a threat, so none of the humanoid figures were targeting her.

Han Li's heart jolted upon seeing this, and the silver flames he had conjured up instantly transformed into a pair of silver fiery ropes that flew toward two of the approaching figures.

At the same time, green and golden light flashed as his Provenance Golden Body and spirit body also appeared before pouncing toward another two of the translucent humanoid figures.

Meanwhile, Daoist Xie opened his mouth to unleash four pillars of golden light at once, which immediately pierced through the bodies of the remaining four translucent figures.

The two humanoid figures that were bound by the pair of fiery ropes were instantly inundated by silver flames that evaporated them into nothingness, but the other two were able to fight on par with the golden body and spirit body, managing to hold their own in hand-to-hand combat.

As for the four humanoid figures that were pouncing toward Daoist Xie, they were immobilized in the instant that the golden light passed through their bodies, and Daoist Xie thrust his palms toward them in a nonchalant manner to instantly destroy them.

Han Li was ecstatic to see this, and he unleashed a pair of azure projections that vanquished the pair of translucent figures locked in combat with the golden body and spirit body as well.

However, not only was Yuan Cha not alarmed or enraged by this, a faint smile appeared on her face as she suddenly made a hand seal.
