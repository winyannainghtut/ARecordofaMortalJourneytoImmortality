In the next instant, wisps of azure Qi emerged from the azure balls of light before transforming into a series of massive logs.

These logs were each over 60 feet in length, and not only were they extraordinarily heavy, they were as hard as iron and steel.

As soon as the logs appeared, they came crashing down from above.

Han Li's expression remained completely unchanged upon seeing this, and he merely made a hand seal, upon which countless streaks of azure sword Qi appeared overhead.

The streaks of sword Qi then transformed into sword threads that formed a massive net, and all of the giant logs that came into contact with the net were instantly shredded.

There was seemingly no end to the storm of giant logs, but they were all destroyed by the azure sword net, and as time passed, the sword net began to rise up against the barrage of logs.

However, the azure balls of light up above were steadily expanding in size, and the logs they were releasing were also becoming larger and larger, swelling to over 100 feet in length each.

However, the sword net was formed by Han Li's bonded Azure Bamboo Cloudswarm Swords, and at his current level of power, each and every sword was comparable to a spirit treasure.

As such, even though the logs were falling with greater and greater ferocity, they were still unable to withstand the sword threads.

A string of resounding booms rang out as the sword net rose up into the heavens before reverting back into 72 streaks of azure light, which plunged into the giant balls of azure light before tearing through them in a frenzy.

All of the azure balls of light were instantly scattered into specks of azure light, while Han Li looked on from down below with an unblinking gaze.

Moments later, the specks of azure light below the dark clouds turned a bright blue color before converging to form massive balls of blue light.

These balls of light were around twice as large as the previous ones, and the pleasant sound of flowing water rang out as waterfalls came crashing down violently from above like a barrage of countless white dragons.

Han Li's expression changed slightly upon seeing this, and he immediately made a hand seal, upon which the Provenance True Devil Projection behind him opened its mouths before expelling a burst of scorching silver flames upward.

The flames formed a sea of fire in the blink of an eye, and as water and fire clashed, a vast sea of white vapor began to permeate through the air.

There was zero visibility within the dense sea of water vapor, and one could only hear the sound of sizzling ring out incessantly from within the mist.

The silver flames being released by the giant Provenance True Devil Projection increased severalfold in intensity at Han Li's behest, and the flames transformed into several fiery wyrms that plunged into the sea of mist.

In the next instant, rumbling thunderclaps rang out, and a series of pavilion-sized silver flowers appeared within the sea of mist in rapid succession, then exploded one after another to tear the sea of mist apart.

After the span of just a few breaths, most of the mist had evaporated, and the fiery wyrms were revealed, rising up directly toward the giant balls of blue light up above.

The fearsome might of the silver flames would most likely instantly destroy the balls of blue light upon contact, but right at this moment, countless arcs of silver lightning suddenly appeared over the surfaces of the balls of light, following which they swelled drastically in size.

All of a sudden, each of the balls of blue light shrank slightly before releasing a head-sized ball of water.

The balls of water seemed to be very clear, but also extremely viscous, and the ripples on their surfaces formed a series of blue spirit patterns that gave off a gentle blue light.

These balls of water descended from above amid a string of rumbling, while the balls of blue light exploded and vanished into nothingness.

Han Li's expression changed drastically upon seeing this, and in the next instant, the balls of blue water were completely inundated by the silver flames down below.

Blue light flashed within the sea of fire, and the balls of water passed through the flames without being affected in the slightest.

"Thousandfold River Water!"

A cold look appeared in Han Li's eyes as the silver flames being released by the Provenance True Devil Projection instantly subsided at his behest.

Immediately thereafter, the projection clenched its six hands into fists before unleashing a flurry of fist projection upward once again.

Brilliant golden light instantly erupted from the surfaces of the balls of water as each and every one of them was struck by dozens of punches in unison.

However, the balls of water were able to withstand the assault and continue to descend through the golden light.

Han Li's heart jolted upon seeing this, and the Provenance True Devil Projection instantly took on a substantial form before unleashing a string of frenzied attacks toward the descending balls of water.

An earth-shattering boom rang out as countless golden suns appeared in the air, alongside powerful shockwaves that swept forth in all directions.

After the shockwaves subsided, the balls of water were nowhere to be seen.

The Provenance Golden Body was still standing resolutely on the spot, but its feet had sunken over 100 feet into the ground, and large sections of its six arms had vanished, having been destroyed by the balls of water.

The fact that even the fearsome Provenance True Devil Projection had been reduced to such a sorry state was a testament to just how powerful the Thousandfold River Water was.

Han Li quickly made a hand seal, and the Provenance True Devil Projection's arms instantly regenerated amid a flash of golden light.

However, right at this moment, a giant crimson ball of light that resembled a scintillating sun appeared up above.

Even though there was only one ball of light on this occasion, it was so massive that it encompassed almost the entire basin.

Following a burst of erratic squawking, countless scorching white Fire Ravens surged out of the giant ball of light, then came raining down as a storm of fireballs.

Even before the fireballs had landed on the ground, a burst of incredibly scorching heat had already descended over the basin.

Han Li's eyes narrowed slightly, and the Provenance True Devil Projection opened its mouth again to unleash the scorching sea of silver flames a second time.

However, on this occasion, as soon as the silver flames left the projection's mouth, they were transformed into glacial flames.

In the next instant, the two bursts of flames clashed, and two completely opposite types of energy exploded in unison.

Thus, a clash between ice and fire ensued, and neither side was able to gain the upper hand.

All of a sudden, Han Li let loose a long cry before pointing a finger upward, and countless streaks of sword Qi appeared once again before combining to form a massive azure blade that was over 100 feet in length.

Immediately thereafter he began to chant something while making a rapid string of hand seals.

Translucent light surged over the surface of the giant azure blade, and it instantly swelled to over 10 times its original size, elongating to over 3,000 feet in length.

A fierce look appeared on all three of the Provenance True Devil Projection's faces, and it grabbed onto the giant blade with two of its hands before slashing it viciously upward.

A streak of azure light flashed through the air, and the massive blade passed through the clashing flames before crashing into the giant ball of light.

The crimson ball of light was instantly sliced in half, and magma-like liquid came gushing forth, exploding into a burst of scorching flames.

The sea of fire down below vanished amid a resounding boom, but right after the Provenance True Devil Projection withdrew its gargantuan blade, the scorching flames in the air transformed into a yellow dust storm that swept forth in all directions.

All of a sudden, the entire sky darkened, and a bone-chilling aura of warfare began to seep out of the dust storm.

Han Li's brows furrowed slightly upon seeing this, and the Provenance True Devil Projection immediately swept its giant blade upward again.

Another streak of piercing azure light sliced through the heavens, parting the entire dust storm, but in the next instant, the two halves of the dust storm combined as one again as if nothing had ever happened.

The massive blade formed by all 72 Azure Bamboo Cloudswarm Sword and the fearsome might of the Provenance Golden Body hadn't inflicted any damage upon the dust storm!

All of a sudden, the sound of war drums rang out, immediately following which groups of grey warriors that resembled earthen statues emerged.

These warriors were either riding atop beastly steeds or armed with sharp bladed weapons, and there was no end in sight to their enormous numbers.

Han Li couldn't help but draw a sharp breath upon seeing this, and before he had a chance to think of an effective countermeasure, the dust storm abruptly swept downward alongside the countless warriors.

Han Li's expression immediately darkened as the Provenance True Devil Projection lashed out with its massive blade once again, destroying countless approaching warriors, only for them to instantaneously regenerate before continuing to descend.
