A ferocious look flashed through the burly devilish lord's eyes, and he immediately tossed his copper mirror up into the air before expelling a mouthful of blood essence, which transformed into a cloud of blood mist that seeped into the mirror.

In the next instant, a loud buzzing sound rang out from the mirror, and a pavilion-sized ghostly face emerged from within it. The sinister ghostly face hovered in mid-air with its eyes closed, and the burly devilish lord quickly pointed at it, following which it immediately opened its eyes, which were filled with dazzling black light.

At the same time, it let loose a bone-chilling cackle before opening its mouth to blast forth a burst of ferocious black flames, catching the streak of azure light completely off guard and engulfing it in the blink of an eye.

"What a fool! Even with a protective Divine Spirit Treasure, one wouldn't be able to last long within my Infernal Devilish Flames," the burly devilish lord chortled while controlling the ghostly face.

The inky-black devilish flames converged into a ball at his behest, then rose up as a thick pillar of flames that trapped the streak of azure light firmly within it.

"Is that so? Perhaps other people wouldn't be able to withstand these flames for long, but for me, breaking free is an easy task."

A calm male voice rang out from within the pillar of black flames, following which the pleasant cry of a bird sounded. A ball of silver light then erupted forth, completely disregarding the devilish flames and rising up to the top of the fiery pillar before transforming into a giant silver bird that was several hundred feet in length.

The bird was shimmering with silver light, and as it spread its wings, all of its feathers burst into flames, causing the air temperature to spike dramatically while the entire sky turned a shade of bright red.

From a distance, it looked as if a silver sun had risen up above the black pillar of flames.

The burly devilish lord's heart jolted upon seeing this, and he immediately tried to make another hand seal, but it was already too late.

The massive silver bird raised its head and let loose a long cry, then opened its beak to expel a burst of suction force.

The pillar of flames down below instantly began to surge into the silver bird's beak as countless black threads, and within the span of just a few breaths, the fiery pillar had become extremely feeble, revealing an azure humanoid figure within it.

The humanoid figure didn't appear to be using any treasures, and his protective spiritual light alone was enough to keep the remaining black devilish flames at bay.

The burly devilish lord drew a sharp breath upon seeing this, and he almost couldn't believe his own eyes.

He was more aware than anyone of how powerful his own Infernal Devilish Flames were, and the fact that this man was able to keep it at bay with his protective spiritual light alone instantly made the devilish lord think that he was perhaps facing a Grand Ascension Stage being.

This thought immediately made him turn extremely pale and sent cold sweat pouring down his back.

All of a sudden, he sprang up before pointing a finger at the ghostly face overhead, then roared the word "explode"!

Immediately thereafter, his arms detached themselves from his body before instantly exploding into two clouds of blood mist that enveloped him in a flash.

At the same time, countless cracks appeared on the surface of the giant ghostly face, and it exploded amid a flash of black light, sending countless thin black threads erupting forth in a frenzy to form a gargantuan net that descended toward Han Li.

Han Li's eyes narrowed slightly upon seeing this, and he immediately thrusted a palm upward while waving his other sleeve nonchalantly toward the distance.

A massive golden hand projection that was around an acre in size instantly appeared before grabbing toward the giant net, and the entire net of black threads was torn apart with ease.

Meanwhile, a loud thunderclap erupted out of Han Li's sleeve, and a bolt of golden lightning shot forth before vanishing in a flash.

In the next instant, the bolt of golden lightning reappeared right above the burly devilish lord, who was about to fly away in retreat as a streak of crimson light, then came crashing down upon him at an incredible speed.

The golden lightning instantly eradicated the blood mist above his head, then hurtled down toward him with unstoppable force.

The burly devilish lord hurriedly shot back in retreat upon seeing this, then opened his mouth to release a shimmering yellow flying dagger, which flew directly toward the oncoming bolt of golden lightning.

The two clashed, and the golden lightning vanished in a flash, but the yellow dagger also became completely dull and devoid of luster before falling out of the heavens like a piece of scrap metal.

With Han Li's current powers, his Divine Devilbane Lightning had become extremely potent against devilish treasures.

As a result of the damage sustained by the flying dagger, the burly devilish lord's face paled as he threw up a mouthful of blood. However, black light suddenly erupted from his body as he continued to retreat, completely disregarding the falling dagger.

"I commend your decisiveness, but I'm afraid that won't be enough for you to escape me," Han Li said in an expressionless manner before taking a large stride forward.

Before he had even completed his stride, a loud thunderclap rang out beneath him, and countless arcs of silver lightning surged out of the sole of his foot before instantly forming a silver lightning formation that was around 10 feet in size.

As soon as he stepped into the formation, he vanished without a trace, then appeared several thousand feet away in the blink of an eye.

The burly devilish lord had only just heaved a sigh of relief when a thunderclap suddenly rang out in front of him, following which a silver lightning formation appeared without any warning.

Almost at the exact same moment, Han Li stepped out of the center of the formation.

The burly devilish lord was greatly alarmed to see this, and he immediately tried to flee toward another direction. However, a giant projection with three heads and six arms suddenly emerged behind Han Li, and it opened its six eyes before swinging its six arms through the air in unison as soon as it appeared.

Golden light flashed, and six giant golden swords, each of which was around 10 feet in length, appeared in its hands before being slashed toward the distance.

Six streaks of golden sword Qi were unleashed before forming a golden thread that swept through the burly devilish lord's body in a flash.

A howl of anguish rang out as the devilish lord's protective treasures and body were instantly sliced in half, upon which a panicked black Nascent Soul instantly emerged within a ball of yellow light.

However, before the Nascent Soul had a chance to get away, the six streaks of sword Qi swept back in unison to erase it off the face of this realm.

A faint smile appeared on Han Li's face upon seeing this, and the golden projection behind him silently disappeared.

It had only taken him an instant to kill this mid-Body Integration Stage devilish lord from the moment that the latter had self-detonated his treasure and arms to escape.

With the array of powerful treasures up his sleeve, this devilish lord was no less powerful than the average late-Body Integration Stage being, but he was obviously no match for Han Li.

......

Within a peculiar space enshrouded within five-colored light, four giant ape-like devilish beings were hovering in mid-air with crimson light flashing from their furry bodies, while a faint odor of blood and gore wafted through the air.

They were surrounded by a dozen or so green-skinned Wood Tribe beings, all of whom wore grim expressions.

In the air above them was a woman wearing a cold expression with her arms crossed. There was a pair of crimson wings spread open on her back, and there were golden and silver runes flashing all over the wings.

The woman was none other than Fei Xiaoxi of the Yaksha Race, and even she was appraising the four Spatial Tempering Stage devilish beings with a wary look in her eyes.

"I had thought that the Boundless Blood Devilish Arts had become defunct in the Elder Devil Realm, but who would've thought that I would encounter it today? Looks like I was right to have come here to face the four of you in person," Fei Xiaoxi said in a cold voice.

"Seeing as you recognize our Boundless Blood Devilish Arts, then hurry up and get these fools to stand down. If they try to battle us, they'll only be offering up their blood essence to us," one of the four devilish beings replied.

"Hehe, if you were all at the Body Integration Stage, even the early-Body Integration Stage, I would flee the scene with them right away, but you're only at the Spatial Tempering Stage; even with the Boundless Blood Devilish Arts, you're no match for all of us. Attack! As soon as an opportunity arises, I'll strike to kill all four of them," Fei Xiaoxi instructed with a cold smile.

The Wood Tribe beings were very wary toward the four devilish beings, but they still sprang into action without any hesitation at Fei Xiaoxi's behest.

Some of the Wood Tribe beings raised both hands up into the air to release countless streaks of azure light, while others opened their mouths to expel bursts of viscous azure Qi, which transformed into ropes swept toward the four devilish beings.
