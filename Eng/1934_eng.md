The golden body gently waved the blade segment through the air, and it instantly vanished amid a flash of piercing purple light.

Only in the hands of the golden body was this blade segment able to unleash the power of laws of heaven and earth.

Immediately thereafter, Han Li laid a hand onto his own storage bracelet and released several treasures at once, all of which flew directly toward the spirit body.

The treasures were comprised of jade pendants or flags, and there was even a ring among them. Following a brief hesitation, a solemn look appeared on Han Li's face, and he tossed a scroll toward the spirit body as well.

The spirit body remained completely expressionless and merely opened its mouth to swallow all of the items that had been tossed toward it. After that, it and the golden body made hand seals in unison, and they both vanished into thin air.

After doing all that, Han Li rotated on the spot, and hundreds of formation flags and formation plates erupted out of his body before flying through the air and setting up five or six similar temporary formations near the sword formation.

He then swept both sleeves up into the air to release several hundred talismans, all of which disappeared into the space overhead in a flash.

After that, 13 balls of purple light emerged from one of his sleeves before transforming into the 13 Purple-striped Gold Devouring Beetles.

Finally, he produced a fist-sized white crystal ball, which he expelled a mouthful of blood essence toward. The ball of blood essence transformed into a cloud of blood mist that instantly vanished into the crystal ball, which then immediately took on a crimson color.

Han Li tossed the crystal ball forward before flicking his fingers toward it while chanting something, and incantation seals of different colors flooded into the crystal ball in a frenzy, causing it to radiate a peculiar spiritual light.

All of a sudden, the crimson light within the crystal ball transformed into an unidentifiable crimson rune, and Han Li exhaled and swept a sleeve toward it, stowing it away amid a flash of azure light.

After standing in silence for a moment, Han Li suddenly stroked a section of his arm, where a mysterious pattern was imprinted, and a wry smile appeared on his face after drawing no reaction from that pattern.

Having set up all of these preparatory measures, Han Li then transformed into a giant golden ape that was over 1,000 feet tall amid a flash of golden light, then stood with his arms crossed at the center of the sword formation and cast his gaze into the distance with a cold expression.

Moments later, a rumbling voice rang out from the distance. "So you've finally decided to stop running."

Immediately thereafter, crimson light flashed, and a small crimson canoe shot forth toward Han Li as a crimson thread.

After the span of just a few breaths, the crimson thread appeared in the air near Han Li before reverting back to its canoe form.

The three identical young men on the canoe cast their eyes toward Han Li in unison.

The young man at the forefront wore a cold mocking smile, while the two behind him were appraising Han Li in an expressionless manner, but their eyes were as sharp as daggers.

"You're a quick little rat, I'll give you that. Are you planning to make a final stand here? Do you really think a sword formation and a few temporary formations will be able to save you?" the young man at the forefront chuckled.

"I won't know until I try; surely you won't expect me to just hand myself over to you," Han Li chortled as he made a grabbing motion with both hands, and spatial fluctuations erupted in the air above the canoe, following which two giant hands, one black and one white, suddenly emerged.

The black hand was radiating boundless grey light, while the white hand had five-colored glacial flames burning all around it, and both of them came crashing down with devastating might.

"Hmph, how insolent!" the young man at the forefront said in an arrogant manner before making a hand seal, and a burst of black Qi erupted behind him. Two grey feelers then sprang out of the black Qi before thrusting directly toward the pair of massive hands.

The feelers struck the giant hands like a pair of iron spears, and in the instant that the two clashed, the pair of massive hands exploded like balloons before disintegrating into specks of spiritual light.

However, the Divine Essencefused Light and five-colored glacial flames imbued within the two hands continued to sweep down from above. As a result, one of the feelers was frozen into a translucent pillar of ice, while the other was shattered amid a few violent flashes of grey light.

"Hmm? Divine Essencefused Light, eh? That's very rare," the young man at the forefront remarked in a slightly taken aback manner.

A cold smile appeared on Han Li's face as he said, "Do you really think a mere clone like you is enough to force me to flee for my life? I was only trying to distance myself from your subordinates."

"Oh? You seem very confident. Does your confidence stem from those two that are hiding in the shadows?" the young man at the forefront chuckled coldly.

Almost at the exact same moment, the two clones behind him suddenly sprang into action.

One of them opened his mouth to expel a ball of black light, which instantly transformed into a small cauldron, and a black pillar of light suddenly erupted out of the cauldron's opening.

Meanwhile, the other clone made a grabbing motion, and an indistinct rainbow pagoda projection emerged before flying through the air.

The two treasures were both attacking what appeared to be patches of empty air.

A pair of resounding booms rang out, and two figures emerged out of thin air amid busts of spatial fluctuations.

One of them was a shimmering golden figure with three heads and six arms, while the other was the green-skinned Han Li, and they were preparing to stealthily approach the small crimson canoe.

Han Li's expression immediately darkened upon seeing this.

A peculiar look appeared on Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang's face as he caught sight of the golden body.

"That's a true devil projection! How interesting; to think that a human was able to hone a true devil cultivation art to such an extent. I wonder what those old geezers will think if they were to hear of this," he chuckled with both a hint of mockery and self-deprecation in his voice.

Han Li wasn't overly surprised to hear this. After all, even though he had altered the Provenance True Devil Arts significantly, the Provenance True Devil Projection had a very distinct form, so anyone who was well-versed in devilish arts would be able to identify its origins right away.

Of course, there were very few human Devil Dao cultivators who would've mastered a devilish cultivation art to this extent, so under normal circumstances, Han reflexively refrained from using this golden body.

However, now that he was facing this clone of Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang, he naturally wasn't going to hold back anything. He cast his gaze toward the Purple Word Cauldron, seemingly in a nonchalant manner, and he was already beginning to chant something internally.

At the same time, the crystal ball that contained the crimson rune emerged silently within one of his huge furry hands.

As he began to use the secret technique, the rune within the crystal ball began to flash, as if it had sprung to life.

Meanwhile, Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang was appraising the golden body and spirit body, and he also seemed to be contemplating something. However, in the next instant, he suddenly seemed to have sensed something, and his expression changed drastically as he yelled, "How dare you try to play these tricks right under my nose? Die!"

As soon as his voice trailed off, a projection with a giant horn on its head and a dozen or so massive feelers suddenly emerged behind him.

The feelers were slightly blurry and indistinct, but as soon as they appeared, they swept violently through the air, covering a distance of several thousand feet in a flash before lashing out at Han Li from afar.

"Hmph, it's too late for you to do anything now!" Han Li harrumphed coldly before crushing the crystal ball in his hand into a ball of piercing light.

The crimson rune flashed once, then vanished into the palm of his hand.

At the same time, a dozen or so azure lotus flowers suddenly appeared around Han Li. Each flower was around a foot in size, and their petals were peerlessly sharp.

The tentacles clashed directly with the lotus flowers, and the latter rotated on the spot, releasing countless streaks of sword Qi that instantly shredded the feelers into countless tiny segments.

Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang chuckled coldly upon seeing this, yet just as he was about to unleash another ability, a cry of surprise suddenly rang out from behind him, followed by a piercing screeching sound.

He hurriedly turned around, just in time to see the Purple Word Cauldron fly out of the grasp of one of the clones behind him.

The clone that had been controlling the cauldron was completely stunned by this turn of events, but he reacted very quickly, making a grabbing motion to conjure up a giant claw projection that encompassed around an entire acre of space down below.

It seemed that there was no way that the Purple Word Cauldron would be able to escape. Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang was quite relieved to see this, yet before he had a chance to think about why this had happened, the giant golden ape down below suddenly thumped its own chest violently and let loose a thunderous roar.

Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang's body swayed involuntarily upon hearing this roar, and his face suddenly paled slightly.

The clone that was grabbing toward the Purple Word Cauldron also shuddered, and the massive hand he had conjured up instantly crumbled away into nothingness.

The Purple Word Cauldron instantly flew away as a streak of purple light, and it was truly about to escape.

"Stop that thing!" Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang yelled with fury and urgency in his voice.

The final clone on the canoe raised an eyebrow upon hearing this before tossing the small pagoda in his hand through the air.
