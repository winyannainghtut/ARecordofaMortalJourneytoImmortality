After devouring all of the golden balls of light, Netherworld Monarch Menace began to chant an incantation, then opened his mouth to release a ball of green blood essence that vanished into the ghostly face in a flash.

The ghostly face on the shield suddenly burped rapidly swelling in stature to resemble a small mountain before biting viciously toward Han Li's direction.

The entire sky abruptly dimmed, and it was as if the ghostly face were about to devour the entire mountain.

"Devour Heaven and Earth!" Han Li exclaimed as his expression changed drastically.

However, he then raised his six hands in unison amid a low roar, releasing a flurry of golden runes that transformed into six balls of shimmering golden light.

The six balls of light instantly teleported over to the mouth of the ghostly face before flying into it in a frenzy.

A string of dull thumps rang out as the balls of golden light exploded into countless runes, which instantly formed a golden vortex.

The vortex quickly swelled to around an acre in area, and it released countless golden runes amid a string of Buddhist chants.

The ghostly face's giant mouth closed around the golden vortex, and both began to glow bright as their powers clashed, creating a mass of intertwining black and golden light that flashed incessantly between the ghostly face and the golden vortex.

A serious look appeared on Netherworld Monarch Menace's face for the first time upon seeing this, and he suddenly took a step forward, upon which he abruptly vanished on the spot.

In the next instant, spatial fluctuations erupted above Han Li, and a giant black foot came stomping down viciously from above alongside a series of balls of crimson light.

Han Li's eyes narrowed slightly as he thrust a hand upward in retaliation, and a scintillating golden sun exploded, releasing a burst of enormous power that stopped the giant foot cold in its tracks.

However, in the next instant, the Netherworld Monarch Menace fully appeared up above, and at this point, he had transformed into a giant that was over 10,000 feet tall.

He lashed out with both arms amid a burst of sinister cackling, and his hands transformed into a pair of dark clouds that swooped down from above with devastating might, releasing a nauseating odor and burst of crimson flames.

As opposed to being alarmed by this attack, Han Li was elated to see that Netherworld Monarch Menace was attacking with his physical body.

He immediately made a hand seal, upon which he swelled to over 1,000 feet tall, and countless silver formations of different sizes appeared all over his body. At the same time, six different types of golden weapons appeared in his hands amid a flash of golden light before being swung upward in retaliation.

An earth-shattering boom rang out across the entire heavens, and Han Li shuddered as he was forced back a couple of steps, while his six golden weapons were completely shattered.

As for Netherworld Monarch Menace, both of his arms had been reduced to clouds of blood mist, and it seemed that he had come out second best from that clash.

However, this injury seemed to have completely stimulated his bloodlust, and instead of retreating, he took a step forward with vicious might.

Countless black patterns appeared on his calf, then exploded into balls of black Qi that transformed into a black dragon that was several hundred feet in length before pouncing directly toward Han Li.

At the same time, all of the sharp spikes on his suit of armor shot forth as streaks of crimson light, and he opened his mouth to release a crimson cloud, from within which countless thumb-sized black insects emerged.

Each insect was around the length of a chopstick with black exoskeletons and crimson wings. Their mouth appendages were as sharp as scissors, and they swooped down toward Han Li as fast as lightning.

Despite this fearsome barrage of attacks, Han Li remained completely unfazed as he rubbed his hands together before raising them upward, releasing six bolts of golden lightning.

The bolts of lightning transformed into six golden pythons, which surrounded the black dragon in a flash.

Thus, a fierce battle ensued between the black dragon and the six pythons.

At this moment, the sharp crimson spikes also reached Han Li, who took a deep breath with his three mouths in unison before blowing out gusts of fierce azure winds.

As soon as the gusts of azure wind swept up the crimson spikes, the latter were sent flying in all directions, completely losing track of their target.

However, the swarms of black insects dealt with the azure wind very intelligently, skirting around it after dividing themselves up into around a dozen groups before continuing to fly toward Han Li.

Han Li paid no heed to this, and only once the insects were less than 100 feet away from him did the layer of scorching silver flames reappear over his body, then swelled to encompass all of the nearby insects in a sea of flames, instantly incinerating them into ashes.

Right at this moment, a burst of black Qi appeared behind Han Li, and a thin ghostly claw plunged through the silver flames and protective spiritual light around his body like lightning, then grabbed toward a certain spot on his back.

All of a sudden, a silver formation on Han Li's back flashed, and the ghostly claw struck it with unerring accuracy.

The claw seemed to be imbued with incredible power, forcing Han Li to stumble forward. However, the silver formation on his back remained completely unscathed.

As Han Li was stumbling forward, he swiveled around to lash out with a golden blade projection, which sliced the black Qi behind him in half to reveal a monkey-like beast that was around three feet tall.

This beast had a single horn on its head and a pair of white pupil-less eyes. A thin gash ran all the way from the top of its head to its groin, and blood was flowing profusely out of the gash.

The monkey-like beast had been sliced in half by the blade projection.

However, Han Li didn't stop there. Instead, he lashed out with his five other hands to release countless arcs of golden lightning, which formed a golden net before swooping down from above.

All of a sudden, the two halves of the beast's body transformed into two bursts of black Qi that shot forth toward either side, passing through the golden lightning net in a flash as if it didn't even exist.

Han Li was quite surprised to see this, and he couldn't help but falter slightly.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, the two bursts of black Qi hurtled back in retreat before combining as one again to form the monkey-like beast.

The beast gave Han Li a cold look before instantly appearing beside the head of the giant Netherworld Monarch Menace, then self-detonated into a burst of black Qi that surged up the giant's nostril.

As a result, the giant's missing arms were instantly regenerated.

"That's a second Nascent Soul! No, it would be more accurate to call it a second soul," Han Li remarked as a cold light flashed through his eyes.

"You must be quite knowledgeable to have identified it right away. Indeed, this second soul was refined using the remains of an ancient beast. Not only is it completely silent in movement, it possesses strength superior to even my own. What are those formations on your back? The fact that it was able to withstand a full-force attack from my second soul tells me that it's not an ability from the lower realms," Netherworld Monarch Menace chuckled coldly as he shook out his pair of new arms.

"Why don't you come and find out for yourself," Han Li harrumphed coldly in response.

At this point, the six golden lightning wyrms had already torn the black dragon apart, and the giant ghostly face and the golden vortex had destroyed one another after a prolonged struggle.

Netherworld Monarch Menace looked up at the two light barriers overhead, and suddenly chuckled, "With that ability at your disposal, I won't be able to pose a threat to you through conventional means. Hehe, it looks like I'll have to use my trump card."

As soon as his voice trailed off, he let loose a shrill cry, and the five golden ghostly devils that were still locked in battle with Jin Tong suddenly disengaged before flying back toward Netherworld Monarch Menace as five golden skulls, then vanished into his giant body in a flash.

The five skulls then appeared on the giant's neck amid a flash of golden light before chanting different incantations in vastly contrasting voices.

As the chanting grew louder and louder, countless black spirit patterns suddenly appeared over Netherworld Monarch Menace's body before transforming into thousands of fist-sized ghostly faces.

All of the faces were extremely life-like and wore a diverse range of different expressions with their eyes, covering every single inch of the giant's body.

Immediately thereafter, Netherworld Monarch Menace made a hand seal, all of the ghostly faces slowly opened their eyes amid a burst of sinister cackling.

All of a sudden, a streak of golden sword Qi appeared out of thin air without any warning before revolving around the giant's head like lightning, then appeared several hundred feet away in a flash, revealing itself to be Jin Tong.

Immediately thereafter, the giant's head rolled down from his body, and Jin Tong immediately released countless streaks of invisible sword Qi that converged toward the giant's headless from all directions, aiming to instantly tear it into shreds.
