"We've finally come out, but we still appear to be in the Myriad Moon Mountain Range," Han Li remarked as he strode out of the light formation and inspected his surroundings.

"While preparing the teleportation formation, I had already done my best to teleport us as far away as possible; even though we're still in the Myriad Moon Mountain Range, we should be on the very outskirts," Fairy Ice Soul said as she also inspected her surroundings with unbridled excitement in her eyes.

Anyone who had been trapped in a certain place for so many years would be ecstatic upon being freed.

"Even if someone were to detect our presence here, it would be too late for them to catch us. I'll summon Zhu Guo'er and Patriarch Hua Shi to this place right away. Do you have any plans, Fellow Daoist Ice Soul? Are you going to return to our human race?" Han Li asked.

"I've only just reached the Grand Ascension Stage, so I'll need some time to consolidate my cultivation base, and I have to refine the treasures I just obtained. As such, I plan to cultivate for a few years in a secluded place before returning to our human race," Fairy Ice Soul replied, clearly having already thought about this.

"That's not a bad idea. However, news of the fact that you've obtained Daoist Tian Ding's inheritance will definitely spread very quickly, so you'll have to be careful," Han Li cautioned.

"Rest assured, Brother Han; I may be inept compared to you, but I'm still a Grand Ascension Stage being, so I'm sure I'll be able to keep myself safe even against powerful enemies as long as I don't fall into any perilous regions," Fairy Ice Soul replied with a smile.

"I'm glad that you're confident in your own abilities. I'm going to stay on the Blood Sky Continent for a while longer, and I may even make a trip to the Thunder Continent, so it could be a very long time until we meet again; look after yourself in the meantime," Han Li said with a smile as he extended a parting salute.

Fairy Ice Soul hurriedly returned the salute, and after also wishing Han Li well, she finally took her leave before departing as a streak of light.

Once she had vanished into the distance, Han Li made a grabbing motion to summon a silver talisman, which he gently waved through the air, upon which it immediately disintegrated into a plume of smoke.

After that, Han Li descended onto a certain mountain and began to meditate under a huge tree, awaiting the arrival of Zhu Guo'er and Patriarch Hua Shi.

Around half a day later, a triangular flying carriage appeared in the distant sky amid a flash of spiritual light, and its passengers were none other than Zhu Guo'er and Patriarch Hua Shi.

Han Li reopened his eyes before rising to his feet.

......

Shortly thereafter, news emerged from the Blood Bone Sect, stating that the blood clones formed by the Five Xue He Clones had all been destroyed, and the mysterious cultivator of the Blood God Arts had also been killed.

However, Tian Jiu and Di Meng had sustained severe injuries in the battle, and only less than half of the disciples who had accompanied them managed to survive.

As for Sect Master Feng, he had perished during the battle.

At the same time, a rumor began to spread, detailing the fact that a female Grand Ascension Stage being from a foreign continent had obtained Daoist Tian Ding's inheritance, and this naturally attracted a lot of interest.

Strangely enough, there were no rumors about Han Li at all; it was as if he had never even appeared in the Myriad Moon Mountain Range.

......

A year and a half later, two Grand Ascension Stage beings of the Blood Sky Continent were hovering in the air above an extremely secluded valley in the Qi Yun Mountain Range, appraising a thin young man with an astonished look in their eyes.

The young man wore a set of black robes, and he had a pair of thin and long eyes that struck the beholder with a very peculiar sense of emptiness.

The young man was currently holding a severed head by its hair, and beneath his feet was a flowing river of blood that stretched as far as the eyes could see.

The head had a set of refined and handsome facial features, and even in death, there was still an incredulous look etched onto it.

The river of blood was around 300 to 400 feet wide and extremely viscous, but wasn't giving off any bloody odor. Instead, it was releasing an aroma close to that of sandalwood, and those who inhaled scent would immediately feel more alert.

A body that had been dismembered into several pieces laid at the black-robed young man's feet, and his legs were plunged into the river halfway up his shins.

However, he was as steady as if he were standing on solid ground, and he was appraising the two Grand Ascension Stage beings before him with a hint of mockery in his eyes.

Among the two Grand Ascension Stage beings, an imposing purple-armored man seemed to have finally repressed the fear in his heart, and roared, "What did you do to us? How did you debilitate our powers so significantly? There's no way Daoist Yan Yu would've been killed so easily had he been at full power! Do you realize that Daoist Yan Yu was an elder of the He Lian Trade Guild, one of the premier powers of the entire Spirit Realm! You killed a core member of the He Lian Trade Guild; even with your powers, your fate is sealed!"

"What's this trade guild supposed to be? If they want to die, then they can come and find me, and I'll make them a part of this river, just like you two are going to be. As for how your powers were restricted, that has nothing to do with us. The refinement of the Myriad Spirit Blood Seal has only just been completed, and it's still unable to restrain its own aura as it pleases; you've simply been unwittingly intimidated by its aura," the black-robed young man replied in a nonchalant manner.

"Nonsense! What kind of treasure could restrict our powers with its aura alone? Even a Profound Heavenly Treasure can't achieve something like this!" the purple-armored man countered.

"You don't know anything! Profound Heavenly Treasures may be powerful, but their powers depend on the realm that they were born in; how much power could a Profound Heavenly Treasure from a small realm like this one possibly possess? Ants like you can't even begin to imagine how fearsome Profound Heavenly Treasures born in higher realms are," the black-robed young man replied with undisguised disdain in his voice.

The purple-armored man faltered slightly upon hearing this, but a thought then occurred to him, and he yelled, "What insolence! I've never heard that our Spirit Realm is a so-called small realm. It seems like you're from another realm, but even so, do you really think you can oppose the power of an entire realm on your own and slaughter living beings as you please for a blood sacrifice?"

Instead of being enraged to hear this, the black-robed young man carefully considered the purple-armored man's words before replying in a serious manner, "It would naturally be impossible for me to slaughter all of the living beings in this entire realm, but if all of the other Grand Ascension Stage beings in this realm are only around the same level of power as you three, then it wouldn't be too difficult to kill all of you given some time."

The purple-armored man's expression darkened slightly upon hearing this.

Right at this moment, his companion, an elderly man with snake patterns all over his body, suddenly transformed into a giant green four-winged snake before flapping his wings vigorously and flying away as a green thread.

In the blink of an eye, he was already over 10,000 feet away, and it seemed that he was on the cusp of escaping.

"How foolish! Do you think a mere Grand Ascension Stage being like you can escape from my Myriad Spirit Blood Seal?" The black-robed young man cast his gaze toward the fleeing snake, then uttered the word "seal", and a mountainous seal projection suddenly appeared above the flying snake amid a flash of crimson light before descending in what appeared to be quite a slow manner.

In the instant that the giant seal projection appeared, the flying snake was somehow completely immobilized and could only look on helplessly as the massive projection descended onto its body.

As soon as the flying snake came into contact with the seal projection, it let loose a bloodcurdling cry, and its body instantly disintegrated into specks of spiritual light alongside the Nascent Soul of the elderly man within it.

These specks of spiritual light were then all absorbed into the seal projection, and as a result, the rather blurry projection became a little clearer.

However, in the next instant, the seal projection vanished into thin air in a flash.

Even though the purple-armored man had been through countless ordeals and had great mental fortitude, he couldn't help but be struck by a sense of despair upon seeing this.

The black-robed young man was unfathomably powerful, and his own powers had been severely restricted, so there was no chance of victory for him.

Even so, he certainly wasn't just going to give up.

While the black-robed young man's gaze was still directed toward the distance, the purple-armored man let loose a thunderous roar, and a giant projection with the head of a dragon and the body of a horse appeared behind him amid a flash of azure light.

As soon as the projection appeared, it opened its mouth to release countless balls of azure lightning amid a string of rumbling thunderclaps.

At the same time, he swept both sleeves through the air, releasing around a dozen treasures of different descriptions that exploded in unison as soon as they were released.

A dozen or so massive balls of light that resembled scintillating suns emerged before crashing directly toward the black-robed young man with unstoppable might, while the purple-armored man's physical body detonated into a cloud of blood mist to reveal his Nascent Soul.

The Nascent Soul took a deep breath to instantly absorb all of the blood mist into its own body, then suddenly disappeared into thin air amid a flash of crimson light.

In the face of the fearsome attacks being directed toward him, a cold smile appeared on the black-robed young man's face, and he made no effort to evade as he slowly extended a palm forward instead.
