Initially, these Buddha projections were only just barely visible, but mere moments later, all of them attained substantial forms amid a flash of golden light.

"Golden bodies! No, those are only crude replicas." The Xue Guang clone was initially quite alarmed to see these Buddha projections, but a derisive smile then quickly appeared on his face.

"Even if they're only golden body replicas, 18 of them is more than enough to vanquish a devil like you!" Buddhist Monk Jin Yue said as he abruptly made a hand seal, and a seven-colored halo that was several tens of feet in size appeared behind his head.

The seven-colored halo swept over the 18 golden Buddha projections, and all of them opened their eyes as if they had sprung to life.

Xue Guang's expression darkened upon seeing this, and he laid a hand onto the back of his own head without any hesitation, upon which a giant crimson skull emerged amid a sharp ringing sound.

The skull was around 50 to 60 feet in size, and there were countless wisps of grey Qi revolving around it. As soon as it appeared, it let loose a ferocious roar and released an astonishing baleful aura.

The white-robed elderly man immediately flapped his Sevenflame Fan toward the distance and also tossed the five shimmering Unbroken Rings forward at the same time.

The Sevenflame Fan was the spirit treasure that inspired the creation of the replica Triflame Fan, which Han Li had used back in the human world.

That spirit treasure replica had helped him overcome countless powerful enemies in the past, and the spirit treasure itself was naturally even more formidable.

A rumbling boom rang out as countless crimson runes swept forth from the surface of the fan, then transformed into a crimson fiery bird that was around 100 feet in size.

The fiery bird flapped its wings, and seven-colored flames surged forth from its body, filling the entire heavens with a scorching aura as the flames swept toward the Xue Guang clone.

As for the five silver rings, in the instant that they were tossed forward, they transformed into five giant rings that were arranged into a line next to one another. It was as if five silver full moons had appeared in the sky, and they descended in unison.

Meanwhile, Buddhist Monk Jin Yue had also sprung into action, chanting a profound incantation that caused the 18 golden Buddha projections to vanish in a flash.

In the next instant, golden light flashed around the Xue Guang clone, and the Buddha projections re-emerged in a completely silent manner. Even though they weren't doing anything, bursts of tremendous invisible force were converging toward Xue Guang from all sides.

Xue Guang harrumphed coldly as a crimson devilish cloud emerged from his body, and he swept his sleeves through the air, sending countless balls of crimson light flying in all directions. At the same time, the crimson skull behind him blurred before hurtling directly toward the fiery bird as a projection.

Thus, a fierce battle ensued between the Xue Guang clone and the pair of Body Integration Stage elders.

......

A rumbling boom akin to an explosive thunderclap rang out, and Han Li's mountains were wrenched out of his grasp while his body was forced back for over 100 feet before he managed to just barely steady himself. A slightly abnormal flush appeared on his face, then disappeared in a flash, and at the same time, the burly devilish man had also been forced back for over 100 feet.

Meanwhile, Han Li's golden body was engaged in a ferocious battle against a mountainous inky-black monster.

Golden light intertwined with black Qi amid a string of rumbling explosions, but both the Provenance Golden Body and the mountainous black monster were able to shrug off each other's attacks with ease. At most, they would be forced back for a short distance before immediately pouncing toward their opponent again, and it was as if they both possessed indestructible bodies.

"Not bad! This is the first time I've encountered someone who's able to match the power of my physical body. However, if this is the extent of your power, then there's no point in continuing this," the burly man said as he flexed his faintly throbbing wrists. The insanity on his face had already disappeared and had been replaced by a frosty expression.

"Don't you think you're spewing too much manure out of that big mouth of yours?" Han Li countered in an expressionless manner as he circulated his own enormous spiritual power, and the slight discomfort he was experiencing was instantly alleviated.

"Hmph, I was trying to allow you to live for a bit longer; seeing as you're interested in accepting my generosity, I'll send you on your way!" the burly man guffawed as the devilish projection behind him instantly adopted a substantial form, revealing itself to be a massive three-headed devilish lion.

As soon as the projection attained a substantial body, its aura was significantly enhanced, and a layer of crimson flames instantly appeared over the surface of the burly man's suit of armor.

The burly man then chuckled coldly as he slowly raised his hands before pointing his fingers toward Han Li and slowly closing his eyes.

Meanwhile, the three heads of the devilish lion slowly opened their eyes, casting their gaze toward Han Li in a completely emotionless manner.

Han Li was immediately struck by a bone-chilling sensation upon seeing this, and he hurriedly made a hand seal, upon which the Provenance Golden Body that was locked in combat with the black monster in the distance abruptly vanished. At the same time, his body swelled drastically in size, and he instantly transformed into a giant golden ape that was over 100 feet tall.

Golden light flashed behind the giant ape, and the golden body appeared before combining as one with the golden ape. As a result, the golden ape's aura was significantly enhanced, and two mountains, one black and one azure, also appeared beside it.

Right at this moment, crimson light flashed from the hands of the burly man, and two extremely dense pillars of crimson light erupted forth. The devilish lion behind him also opened its three mouths to expel three pillars of light, which were azure, black, and white in color.

After just a single flash, the five pillars of light combined as one mid-flight to form an even thicker pillar of four-colored light.

The pillar of light wasn't releasing any sound at all, but the terrifying power imbued within it made even Han Li shudder with apprehension. He immediately placed his hands onto the two mountains beside him, then injected his magic power into them in a frenzy.

The pair of mountains swayed before swelling to several thousand feet in size, forming a massive barricade in front of Han Li.

In the next instant, the four-colored pillar of light struck the pair of mountains with tremendous force, and an earth-shattering boom rang out as a burst of four-colored light rose to over 10,000 feet tall, then completely inundated both of the mountains in its path, as well as the giant ape behind the mountains.

Within the four-colored light, the two extreme mountains rapidly shrank as their surfaces warped and twisted, and they both vanished within the span of just a few breaths.

Without the barricade formed by the two extreme mountains, the fearsome four-colored light was free to surge directly toward Han Li.

The giant golden ape immediately let loose a thunderous roar as a suit of black devilish armor appeared over its body, and the suit of armor released countless black runes, which formed a giant black light barrier that kept the torrent of four-colored light at bay.

A string of resounding booms rang out as the black light barrier strained and groaned, looking as if it could collapse at any moment.

The golden ape let loose another ferocious roar as golden light swirled over its body, and it swelled to over 10 times its original size. At the same time, two more heads and four additional arms appeared on its body amid a flash of golden light, transforming it into a colossal ape with three heads and six arms. As soon as the transformation was complete, Han Li made a grabbing motion upward with all six of his hands, and six balls of piercing golden light emerged in unison before combining as one to form a golden vortex that was around an acre in size.

The golden vortex rotated on the spot, releasing a burst of tremendous power that clashed in a vicious manner with the sea of four-colored light.

Another deafening boom rang out, and powerful shockwaves swept forth in all directions, causing the nearby space to twist and warp, as if it were about to be torn apart.

The burly man's expression changed slightly upon seeing this, and he immediately withdrew the pillars of crimson light being released by his hands.

Furthermore, his face had paled slightly in the wake of that attack, seemingly indicating that he had expended a lot of energy to unleash it.

At the same time, the three-headed devilish lion also closed all three of its mouths to cease its attacks, and the light in its six eyes had dimmed significantly as well.

However, after the dazzling lights faded to reveal what lay in the distance, a look of astonishment appeared on the burly man's face for the first time.

The giant golden ape was still standing, making a series of hand seals with its six hands. Not only had the massive golden vortex in front of it not disappeared, it had swelled to over 10 times its original size, and golden halos were being released from its center.

"That attack I just unleashed was about as powerful as a casual strike from a Grand Ascension Stage being; it seems I really did underestimate you," the burly man said with a hint of surprise in his eyes.

"It would be rude not to reciprocate, so why don't you take one of my attacks as well?" Han Li said in a cold voice as he made a grabbing motion with all six of his hands, and the giant vortex was rapidly compressed into a head-sized ball of golden light.

Han Li then abruptly stepped forward, and his enormous body instantly vanished alongside the golden ball of light.

The burly man's pupils contracted upon seeing this, and he immediately looked up, just in time to see Han Li reappear above him amid a flash of golden light before hurling the golden ball of light viciously downward from above.
