The place appeared to be a Buddhist Temple .

The area wasn’t small . There was even a small gate to either side, each a passage to a different area .

Han Li quickly swept his gaze past the large hall and eventually looked at the two rows of wooden cabinets .

The wooden cabinets were white as snow and faintly released threads of icy Qi . They were made from the snow wood famous throughout the spirit realm .

The wood was an ideal material to refine ice attributed treasures, but here it was being used as the material for a common cabinet . This was so extravagant, it left Han Li speechless .

The cabinets had a dozen various-colored tools laid on top of them . From a distance, he could see scepters, alms bowls, small bells, and other items .

Han Li narrowed his eyes and his spiritual senses swept past the objects . After a brief moment of shock, delight beamed from his face .

The tools possessed astonishing spiritual Qi, every one of them a top-grade half-finished treasure . If the original master refined them fully, they would be considered common spirit treasures at the very least, if not Divine Spirit Treasures .

Most importantly, from the outer appearance of the treasures, he knew they were obscure treasures of extraordinary abilities .

Even if he spent the effort to truly refine them completely, their effectiveness would still be as powerful as treasures refined by their original master . In this case, they could be considered top-grade treasures of the spirit realm .

Han Li shook his sleeve and suddenly, a wave of azure mist flew out and swept over the area, sweeping up every last treasure .

After acquiring so many powerful treasures, Han Li felt delighted .

After looking past the hall once more, he slowly lowered his head and looked at one of the mats several times . Suddenly, he let out a yelp as if he discovered something .

He immediately swiped his hand out the ground . Woosh . The mat silently entered his grasp . Not only did he find it flexible as water and numbing to the touch, but he sensed a wave of spiritual Qi suddenly blow past him .

“This is . . . ” Han Li’s eye flickered .

The mat was clearly refined from some sort of spirit grass . It survived an unknown number of years yet it was still brimming with spiritual Qi .

His expression stirred as if he had discovered something . Suddenly, he placed the mat underneath his nose and took a sniff, catching a faintly fishy scent .

Han Li’s face turned off and he flipped his other hand . In an azure flash, a meter-long sword appeared in his hand .

He flung it at the mat and shook his wrist, chopping at it with a streak of swordlight .

An astonishing scene occurred . The swordlight sliced atop the mat with seemingly unstoppable force and entered several inches deep before being firmly deflected .

Yellow light roamed across the surface of the light and restored the cut damage from the sword . The grass alone had blocked the strike from the Bamboo Cloudswarm Sword .

Han Li flipped the mat several times and muttered, “This must be the legendary Cloth Armor Grass! It is a truly fantastical item . The grass by itself is capable of blocking the strikes of blade-type magic treasures . If turned into armor, it’ll be a top-grade defense . It is a pity that it’s deeply vulnerable to fire-attributed attack . This is truly an Immortal’s residence . They used such a vastly important material as a mere mat . ”

Since he’s discovered the mat’s value, he naturally wouldn’t leave it there .

He promptly stretched out a pitch-black palm from his sleeve and he casually grasped towards the ground . A grey wave of light soon rolled across it .

As grey light flickered, hundreds of mats silently vanished from the ground, sweeping the entire hall clear .

When his spiritual sense swept through the storage pouch and saw the mats neatly arranged, he nodded with satisfaction . Since the grass has long been extinct in the spirit realm, the mats alone made the trip worth it .

With that thought, Han Li let out a long sigh and took a deep breath . For some reason, he felt the scent of the sandalwood seemed to have grown denser .

“Sandalwood!”

He suddenly turned his head and his eyes lit up as he quickly looked at the incense burner at the corner of the room .

The incense stick in the burner was burned halfway and its color was a faint yellow . It was unknown how long it was placed there .

Han Li’s brow stirred and he took large strides towards the corner . But before he arrived, he had already looked at the incense burner with his spiritual sense and immediately frowned .

Surprisingly, the incense burner was made out of common bronze . It couldn't be considered a magic tool .

Han Li blinked and he already walked in front of the incense burner . He then lowered his head and looked at the remaining third of the burning incense stick . A rich scent was leaking from the stick .

The stick appeared to be more than meets the eye . From its appearance, it was no different from a common incense stick . But since it was able to retain a dense fragrance after so much time had passed, it must be extraordinary .

Han Li looked at it for a long while and his face turned grim .

He raised his hand and reached out to extinguish the burning incense, but before he touched it, spiritual light flashed and a layer of azure light wrapped around his fingers .

With extreme care, he put out the tip of the burning incense and nothing happened .

However, Han Li’s expression still remained odd . He sternly looked at the incense several more times and took a long sniff before wearing a pensive face .

Suddenly, he flicked his finger and red light flashed . A rice-sized star shot out from his fingertips and struck the end of the incense stick .

As the light faded away, the incense wasn’t reignited .

Han Li narrowed his eyes, faintly betraying a trace of excitement . He flicked his finger again and a crimson fireball shot out from the tip of his finger . It floated motionlessly in the air .

When the fireball struck the end of the incense stick, he stared in silence .

As a result, the scorching flames hadn’t burned the incense stick in the slightest .

“As expected, its the Serene Blackice Incense! It wards off one’s inner demons when breaking through to the Body Integration stage!”

When Han Li saw this, he wore a face of delight .

He promptly flipped his hand and a pure-white jade box appeared in his hand . He carefully put the stick into his hand .

Afterwards, his body shifted as he looked for the other half-burned incense stick at the other corners of the hall . With that said, he summoned a jade box in his hand with a flicker and it completely vanished .

Afterwards, Han Li took another look throughout the hall . It was a pity there were many things there to begin with . Apart from the shrine and the withered spirit fruits offered to the shrine, there was nothing else .

With that, he eventually took a look at the shrine .

Purple light shimmered from the shrine and it appeared three meters tall . It contained the statue of a god as if it had been carved from top-grade jade .

The god statue wore green robes and held a snow-white horsetail whisk in one hand and a purple gourd in the other . He had a long beard and mustache trailing down his chin, giving him a faintly Immortal aura .

However, Han Li simply looked at the god statue for a short moment more, and he couldn't help but betray his shock .

He suddenly discovered that no matter how long he stared at the statue’s face, he could only see a haze of glimmering green light in front of it . He hadn’t been able to perceive the statue’s true appearance .

Suddenly, he narrowed his eyes and blue light soon shined from them . He then forcefully peered at the god statue’s face .

It did have an effect . He gradually saw through green light mist covering the statue’s face and saw it thin out .

His mood lit up and his gaze grew focused, wanting to look at the god statue’s face .

But before he could see the finger details, a heavenly sound and a Buddhist chant rang through his mind . As his ears rang, his entire spiritual sense was thrown into disarray .

Han Li's eyes turned black and he staggered to the ground . He took a seat, nearly dazed .

Fortunately, his spiritual sense was comparable to Body Integration-grade cultivators . After hastily circulating the Great Development Arts through his body, he eventually regained clarity of mind and stood back up .

After straightening himself, he took another look at the god statue with bewilderment .

The god statue was so strange; even given his current cultivation stage, he wasn’t able to see its true appearance . The statue itself was a grand treasure of immeasurable power .

Since it was enshrined, the statue must’ve been modeled after an important figure even in the True Immortal Realm .

The god statue was an immensely profound object . Even a few vastly powerful individuals in the spirit realm, drew the support of god statues to manifest the primal soul or soul fragment from a deity an unfathomable distance away .

Even though it had never been heard of for an immortal of the True Immortal Realm to use such a method to descend into the Spirit Realm, taking this god statue would definitely be unwise if it really were modeled after an important figure of the True Immortal Realm .

Han Li’s expression wavered for a long while before he eventually took a deep breath . After forcefully suppressing his desires, he looked away from the shrine and to a door at the side .

His body stirred and he walked over without any further hesitation . And with a mental command, the huge ape puppet followed after him .

Soon, all that was left in the hall was the lone shrine .

At that moment, Han Li already walked through a passage and arrived in front of a dozen side rooms . The rooms didn’t appear very large and there all appeared identical .

Han Li quickly looked at them and had the huge ape puppet open the doors to the rooms one by one . When he saw that nothing happened, he began to flicker and enter each of the rooms .
