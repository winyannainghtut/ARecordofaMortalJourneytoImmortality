Han Li then pointed a finger downward, and the azure chain immediately transformed into a thin thread before abruptly tightening, and the giant turtle was dismembered into countless chunks.

Right at this moment, spatial fluctuations erupted from the surface of the lake, and a translucent white bowl emerged before instantly swelling to around an acre in size.

The dismembered carcass of the giant turtle fell into the bowl with unerring accuracy, following which the bowl was drawn back to Han Li by a wave of his hand.

During its flight, it returned to its original size, and in the blink of an eye, it had returned to Han Li's grasp.

He swept his spiritual sense into the bowl in an unhurried manner before a pleased look appeared on his face.

The Xuan Wu bloodline within this massive turtle wasn't all that pure, but it would suffice for the cultivation of his 12 Awakening Transformations.

With that in mind, he flipped his hand over to stow the bowl into his storage bracelet, then cast his gaze toward the golden spirit plant before drawing it into his own grasp as well.

The plant wasn't going to be very useful to him, but it was clearly extremely precious to some beasts. Otherwise, it wouldn't have attracted so many powerful beasts and caused such a fierce battle.

If he could find someone who needed this plant, it could be used as a decent exchange token.

After that, Han Li released a burst of silver flames to incinerate all of the beast carcasses on the surface of the lake into ashes, then prepared to depart.

However, right at this moment, a burst of faint buzzing rang out from his body, and he faltered slightly before a smile appeared on his face.

He flipped a hand over to produce an egg-sized white crystal ball that had bursts of light surging over its surface, as well as specks of light that were around the size of grains of rice flashing incessantly within it.

Han Li stared into the crystal ball for a moment before flying away as a streak of azure light in a completely different direction from before.

Meanwhile, a streak of bright white light was flying through the air at an incredible speed above a barren plain millions of kilometers away from Han Li.

Close to 10 kilometers behind the streak of white light was a massive sea of turquoise mist that encompassed virtually the entirety of heaven and earth and was releasing a deafening rumbling sound.

Furthermore, it wasn't any slower than the streak of white light. In fact, it was a sliver faster, if anything.

The two flew over a distance of thousands of kilometers in the blink of an eye, and it didn't take long for the distance between the two of them to be closed down to within five kilometers.

A burst of sinister cackling rang out within the sea of mist, following which the front section of the mist suddenly transformed into a giant green scorpion projection and a massive blue toad projection.

The scorpion projection raised its huge stinger before releasing a pillar of dark green light, while the giant blue toad opened its mouth, and all of sudden, the space within a radius of several kilometers abruptly congealed as the result of some type of mysterious restrictive force, and the streak of white light involuntarily decelerated.

As such, the pillar of dark green light reached the streak of white light in a flash, and just as the two were about to clash, a flurry of countless five-colored runes suddenly emerged from within the white light.

A burst of violent tremors erupted, and the streak of white light was able to struggle free from the restrictive force.

A crimson bolt of lighting then sprang out of the white light to strike the pillar of green light, and even though the bolt of lightning appeared entirely unremarkable, it was able to instantly dispel the pillar of green light.

At the same time, a burst of urgent chanting rang out from within the streak of white light, and it abruptly vanished on the spot, only to reappear close to 10 kilometers away in the next instant.

Situated within the white light was none other than Mo Jianli, and he was holding a small white flag in one hand, and a dark red hammer in the other.

There were strands of green Qi binding around half of his body, while the other of his body was covered in a layer of peculiar blue ice.

He wore a grim expression as he cast a glance toward the sea of mist, then immediately continued onward without any hesitation.

Immediately thereafter, the scorpion and toad projections vanished in a flash, and the sea of mist continued to give chase.

Thus, the process repeated itself. Whenever the sea of mist got too close, Mo Jianli would be forced to use the two treasures he was holding to dispel the oncoming attacks, then open up some distance again.

This chase had already gone on for a day and a night, and even with Mo Jianli's Grand Ascension Stage cultivation base, he had expended close to half of his magic power.

If he hadn't been notified earlier by the treasure that he was carrying that Han Li was nearby, he would've most likely already considered unleashing some type of self-harming secret technique to save himself.

Thankfully, a distance of a few million kilometers wasn't very far for beings of their caliber, and right after Mo Jianli used his treasures to dispel another wave of attacks, a streak of azure light suddenly appeared in the distance up ahead.

Mo Jianli was ecstatic to see this, and as opposed to using his teleportation ability again, he threw his white flag up into the air, releasing a series of white halos that formed a thick light barrier around him.

At the same time, he lashed out viciously toward the sea of mist with his red hammer.

With Han Li coming to assist him, he was naturally going to teach his pursuer a good lesson.

An earth-shattering boom rang out, and the thick blanket of dark clouds in the sky was abruptly forced apart as a bolt of red lightning that was several thousand feet in length came crashing down upon the giant toad projection.

The projection was dispelled in a flash, and strangely enough, the giant scorpion projection also let loose an agonized hissing sound as its body disintegrated into mist as well.

After that, the sea of mist began to converge toward the center, and moments later, the mist completely faded to reveal a monstrous creature with a pair of crimson eyes.

The creature had the body of a scorpion but the head of a toad, and it was over 100 feet in length.

It also had a pair of giant wings that seemed to be caught somewhere between illusion and reality, and there were countless human faces writhing on those wings.

A cold light flashed through the creature's eyes, and it let loose a string of loud croaks, while a burst of sinister cackling rang out from its wings.

As soon as this sound entered Mo Jianli's ears, his spiritual sense was struck by a sense of intense drowsiness.

His heart immediately jolted, and he knew that he was in a very perilous situation, but his entire body was so sluggish that he was unable to muster up any spiritual sense to resist.

To think that even after being pursued by this creature for so long, it still had such a dangerous spiritual sense secret technique up its sleeve.

Right at this moment, the giant creature flapped its wings, unleashing a pair of giant blades that were several tens of feet in length each, both of which slashed directly toward Mo Jianli.

The blades seemed to be moving quite slowly, but they reached Mo Jianli in the blink of an eye before infiltrating into his protective light barrier without any inhibition.

Mo Jianli was truly alarmed to see this, and he was just about to adopt desperate measures to save himself when spatial fluctuations suddenly erupted behind him, and an intrigued voice rang out.

"What is this thing? It's quite an interesting creature!"

As soon as the voice trailed off, countless arcs of golden lightning sprang forth amid a rumbling thunderclap before striking the two giant blades with devastating force.

Han Li could tell that Mo Jianli was in great peril, so he immediately teleported over to Mo Jianli before unleashing his Divine Devilbane Lightning to oppose the oncoming attack.

As soon as the golden lightning came into contact with massive blades, the latter immediately disintegrated into mist again as if they had encountered the bane of their existence.

In the next instant, turquoise mist surged behind the monstrous creature, following which its wings reappeared, but they were noticeably smaller than before.

The creature's pupils contracted, and a hint of fear appeared in its eye as it cast its gaze toward Han Li.

Meanwhile, Han Li gently patted Mo Jianli's shoulder, and a burst of refreshing coolness immediately surged through the latter's entire body.

As a result, Mo Jianli's sluggishness was instantly alleviated, and he regained control over his own spiritual sense.

"Thank you, Brother Han. This Che Qizi was a vastly renowned creature even in the ancient Asura. Even if a Grand Ascension cultivator were to be trapped in its poisonous mist, they would quickly be reduced to nothingness," Mo Jianli hurriedly cautioned.

Han Li was enlightened upon hearing this, and as opposed to being fearful, the intrigue in his eyes only grew more pronounced. "So this is a Che Qizi; I was wondering why you didn't dare to face it head-on. Speaking of which, I don't recall any tomes that state that this creature is adept in captivation secret techniques."

He instantly arrived in front of Mo Jianli in a flash and began to carefully inspect this Che Qizi.

"I don't know why that is, either. There are very little records regarding these creatures, so perhaps it was merely an oversight. If it weren't because of this, I wouldn't have been placed in such a perilous situation," Mo Jianli said with a wry smile as he pulled out a vial and took some magic power regenerative pills.
