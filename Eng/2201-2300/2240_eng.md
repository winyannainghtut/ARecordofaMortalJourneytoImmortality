"Quick! We have to strike it down now; its aura is becoming more and more powerful, so it must be recovering its powers!" the elderly man yelled as he swept his spiritual sense toward the carcass.

He then vanished on the spot before reappearing over 1,000 feet away.

Immediately thereafter, he laid a hand onto the top of his own head, releasing a burst of blue light, within which sat a miniature humanoid figure that was completely identical to him.

As soon as the miniature humanoid figure appeared, a string of blue beads flew out of its body.

Each bead was only around the size of a thumb, but they were of an extremely deep blue color with impeccably smooth surfaces.

All of a sudden, the beads transformed into balls of light the size of wagon wheels at the elderly man's behest, then flew toward the giant carcass with devastating force.

As for the black-robed woman, she gritted her teeth before transforming into a cloud of crimson mist that vanished into the nine-headed snake projection behind her.

Immediately thereafter, the world's origin Qi within the abyss surged into the nine-headed snake projection in a frenzy, allowing it to instantly take on a substantial form.

In this form, the snake had resplendent colorful scales, but its nine heads were as red as blood, and it opened its cavernous mouths once again to release purple devilish flames that were several times purer than what had been unleashed before.

Even though the carcass hadn't unleashed any attacks yet, the sense of pressure it was giving off struck both of them with a strong sense of foreboding.

The carcass had risen to its feet, but it seemed yet to return to normal as its movements were still quite clumsy and maladroit.

The dozen or so balls of blue light crashed into the invisible wall near the carcass, triggering a string of earth-shattering explosions that sent powerful shockwaves erupting in all directions.

These balls of light didn't appear to be all that remarkable, but all of them were imbued with incredible power.

The carcass raised its arms to shield itself, but it was still forced back a step with each ball of light that exploded.

After taking around a dozen steps backward in succession, the invisible wall around it finally shattered, and its smooth jade-like front limbs were quickly riddled with countless thin cracks.

Before the carcass had a chance to do anything, the nine-headed snake also arrived before transforming into nine chains of flames that bound themselves tightly around the massive carcass.

The purplish-black chains of flames were giving off an incredibly corrosive aura, instantly branding deep black gashes onto the carcass.

The dozen or so balls of light also began to bombard the carcass from all directions.

In the face of their combined attacks, the giant carcass had been forced onto the back foot, and both the elderly man and black-robed woman were ecstatic to see this.

Right at this moment, a delicate figure appeared above the massive carcass amid a burst of spatial fluctuations.

The elderly man and black-robed woman focused their eyes upon the small figure, and their faces instantly paled significantly

The small figure was none other than the little girl formed by the Stemborer Queen's soul!

Wasn't she being kept at bay by Bao Hua and the others? How had she suddenly appeared here?

The elderly man and black-robed woman could only continue to attack the carcass while being extremely wary of the little girl.

The little girl's face was clearly paler than it had been before, and she completely ignored the elderly man and black-robed woman as she turned to the carcass before saying something in a voice that was very pleasing to the ears. However, neither the elderly man nor the black-robed woman were able to understand what she was saying.

A layer of white light appeared around the carcass after hearing what the little girl had to say, and it raised its head through the attacks from the blue balls of light while completely ignoring the flaming chains. It then focused its gaze on the little girl and replied in the same unknown language.

The giant carcass was speaking in a nonchalant and unhurried manner, but the little girl seemed to be very displeased, and her voice abruptly rose a few octaves as if she were arguing with the carcass.

The elderly man and black-robed woman were rather perplexed to see this, but they were also taking advantage of this opportunity to attack the carcass even more vigorously.

The balls of blue light accelerated by around twofold, flying around the carcass like a series of shooting stars.

Meanwhile, sharp spikes erupted out of the surfaces of the chains of flames, embedding themselves deep into the carcass and corroding it at a noticeably faster rate.

Of course, as a precautionary measure against potential retaliation from the carcass and the little girl, the elderly man and black-robed woman were gliding back in retreat.

However, much to their surprise, the carcass paid no heed to them at all and merely continued to communicate with the little girl in that unknown language.

The little girl was very urgent and agitated, while the carcass was very calm and almost a little smug, creating a very strange contrast.

All of a sudden, a fierce look appeared on the little girl's face, and she pointed a finger downward.

A speck of black light appeared on her fingertip, and it swelled dramatically in size while becoming extremely bright, as if it could absorb all of the light in the nearby area.

All of the world's origin Qi in the entire underwater abyss erupted into a frenzy, and a burst of extremely fearsome power of laws descended.

"That's the law of time!"

The Nascent Soul of the elderly man was seated on the top of his head, and a horrified look immediately appeared on its face.

As for the nine-headed snake that the black-robed woman had transformed into, it instantly severed the nine flaming chains in its mouths, then shot back several thousand feet before finally stopping in a wary manner.

Escaping on her own could attract the attention of the little girl and plunge her into grave peril. Otherwise, the black-robed woman would've fled the scene completely.

After the little girl unleashed her law of time, the massive carcass tremored slightly, and it began to speak a little faster, seemingly rather wary of the little girl.

The little girl also began to speak in a more urgent manner, and moments later, the carcass seemed to have made some sort of concussion as it opened its mouth to release a giant inky-black crystal that was around the size of a house.

A pleased look appeared on the little girl's face, and the black light on her fingertip was withdrawn as she drifted toward the black crystal.

However, right as she was about to set foot on the crystal, an extremely fearsome aura suddenly erupted from the carcass's body, and it struggled free from the flaming chains before swiping a limb through the air, slicing all of the surrounding blue balls of light in half and causing them to explode.

An enraged look appeared on the little girl's face upon seeing this, and the black light on her fingertip reappeared as her body blurred in preparation to teleport away.

However, a massive black mouth that was filled with sharp fangs suddenly opened up on the inky-black crystal down below, and it instantly swallowed the little girl before flying back into the giant carcass's mouth.

The elderly man and black-robed woman were stunned to see this, and after a quick conversation, the former's Nascent Soul returned to his body, while the latter reverted back to her human form.

The two of them then immediately fled together.

Having just witnessed the carcass dispelling their trump cards so easily, they knew that they were no match for it and could only escape to reunite with Bao Hua and the others.

However, in the instant that they decided to flee, specks of light suddenly converged within the massive eye sockets of the carcass, forming two balls of black flames.

It then cackled as it pointed a finger twice into the distance, and two balls of black light emerged before vanishing in a flash.

The power of the law of time instantly reappeared to envelop the elderly man and black-robed woman, and all of a sudden, both of them felt their surroundings blur into an unrecognizable swirl.

Once the surrounding area settled again, they discovered a giant white skull right in front of them, appraising them with a sinister expression.

The two of them had reappeared back to where the carcass was under the effect of the law of time.

They were naturally extremely alarmed by this, yet before they had a chance to do anything, the carcass had already opened its cavernous mouth to devour them.

......

In the air above the water, the devilfied Han Li was currently pulling a hand that was riddled with silver formations out of the body of a human-faced stemborer with an azure exoskeleton.

The stemborer was over 1,000 feet in length with a pair of massive front limbs that were several times larger than its own body.

Right as Han Li withdrew his hand, the stemborer's front limbs suddenly sagged like a pair of balloons, instantly reverting back to the same size as all of its other limbs.

Han Li cast his gaze downward, and a befuddled frown appeared on his face upon failing to discover any traces of blood seeping out of the stemborer's body.
