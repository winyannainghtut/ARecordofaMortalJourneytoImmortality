A dull thump rang out as a shimmering golden fist shattered the wind blade with a vicious blow.

Immediately thereafter, Han Li appeared in front of Daoist Xie as he slowly withdrew one of his giant fists.

The Stemborer Queen faltered slightly upon seeing this.

That wind blade seemed to be quite ordinary, but in reality, it had been imbued with enormous power, and even the average spirit treasure wouldn't have been able to oppose it.

"Looks like I underestimated you; your physical body is quite powerful as well. I recall that among the group of Grand Ascension Stage beings that I trapped earlier, there was a demonic being with a very similar form to yours; are you using the same cultivation art as him?" the Stemborer Queen asked.

She was completely disregarding Daoist Xie and Bao Hua, choosing to focus entirely on Han Li.

"You must be referring to Sacred Ancestor Nie Pan. My Provenance True Devil Arts are slightly different, but our cultivation arts are indeed related. I possess a lot of powerful treasures and abilities, but in reality, my greatest trump card just so happens to be this physical body of mine as well," Han Li said as he made a hand seal with each of his six hands, upon which purplish-golden scales and silver patterns emerged all over his body.

At the same time, several giant true spirit projections emerged behind him before fusing as one with his body, and he suddenly transformed into a fiendcelestial that was over 10,000 feet tall with countless runes revolving around him.

His purplish-golden scales then transformed into a suit of intricate purplish-golden armor with countless runes engraved on its surface, and it was giving off an incredibly fearsome baleful aura.

Meanwhile, a tiny miniature humanoid figure that was identical to Han Li in appearance was seated in his dantian with a layer of silver flame burning around it.

Han Li's Nascent Soul had ignited an essential flame that was burning through his essential power.

As a result, his magic power and physical body would be enhanced by as much as twofold, but he wouldn't be able to maintain this form for long, and the after-effects were definitely going to be very severe.

The disdainful look on the Stemborer Queen's face finally faded upon seeing this.

"Is this the Holy Nirvana Physique of the Elder Devil Race? Wait, that's not all... This is the Hundred Meridian Refinement Mantra! How do you possess a secret technique from the Hundred Refinement Mountain of the True Immortal Realm? Ah, I see, you must've obtained this cultivation art from the Hundred Refinement Mountain traitor that fled down to the lower realms. Hehe, even so, you haven't received any guidance from a true immortal of the Hundred Refinement Mountain; do you really think your half-assed mastery of this secret technique will allow you to oppose me?" the Stemborer Queen said with a mocking sneer.

In the next instant, countless golden and silver runes emerged on the surface of the Stemborer Queen's body, and it swelled drastically in size once again to match Han Li's enormous stature.

The two gargantuan beings had virtually taken up the entire underwater abyss, and both of them were releasing extremely fearsome auras.

"I won't know if I can oppose your True Extreme Physique or not until I give it a try," Han Li harrumphed coldly as a silver visor appeared over his three heads, leaving only his six bright and piercing eyes exposed.

He then let loose a thunderous roar, and three balls of light of different colors emerged from his body, each of which contained an extremely life-like miniature mountain.

The three mountains crashed into one another to form a single massive ball of light, and Han Li reached into the ball of light to pull out a gigantic staff that was of a dark azure color.

Not only was the staff extremely thick, there were countless five-colored spirit patterns etched onto its surface, and it seemed to be incredibly heavy.

Han Li gripped onto the giant staff before casting a cold gaze toward the Stemborer Queen, then swung the staff viciously toward his opponent.

A huge spatial rift appeared in the wake of the gargantuan staff, and a tremendous burst of wind pressure came crashing down with devastating might.

With his Third Nirvana Transformation, Han Li's physical body could already match that of some of the powerful legendary true spirits, but now that he had ignited his essential flame as well, his strength had truly reached an astounding level.

The Stemborer Queen's eyes narrowed slightly upon seeing this, and it raised a pair of scissors-like limbs attached to its abdomen to oppose the massive descending staff.

A ball of rainbow light exploded amid a resounding boom, and the entire underwater abyss tremored violently as powerful shockwaves erupted in all directions in a frenzy.

Despite this, Han Li and the Stemborer Queen both remained as still as a pair of immovable mountains.

Once all of the light up above faded, it was revealed that the giant staff and the pair of sharp insect limbs were locked in a complete standstill.

The staff was unable to descend any further, but the pair of limbs were able to repel it, either, and it seemed that the two sides were evenly matched.

Han Li was quite stunned to see this, and he immediately raised his staff again before unleashing a flurry of attacks, sending countless staff projections sweeping toward his opponent from all sides.

The Stemborer Queen's expression darkened slightly upon seeing this, and it retaliated with its many limbs, creating countless limb projections in the surrounding space as well.

Neither of them were using any magic power and were purely clashing with their physical strength.

All of a sudden, a series of tornados erupted out of the water, and the entire space tremored violently as countless thin spatial rifts emerged, while one massive wave after another was swept up on the surface.

The battle between these two gigantic creatures had plunged the entire underwater abyss into a doomsday-like scenario.

A resounding thump rang out as the Stemborer Queen's back was struck by Han Li's staff during a lapse in concentration, and it was sent flying for over 1,000 feet.

However, in the next instant, the Stemborer Queen let loose an enraged roar and shot back like an arrow, instantly reaching Han Li before unleashing countless white wind blades toward him using its sharp appendages.

All of these wind blades were imbued with tremendous power, and they had been unleashed in extremely close quarters, so Han Li was forced to scramble to defend himself.

All of a sudden, a pair of pristine white fists emerged from behind the flurry of wind blades, pressing against Han Li's chest before lashing out in a vicious surprise attack.

Two massive indentations appeared on Han Li's suit of purplish-golden armor, and he was sent flying backward, only managing to right himself after flipping over several times in succession.

The Stemborer Queen immediately pressed its advantage as it flapped its wings and shot forth in a flash, slashing its sharp limbs toward Han Li like a series of lethal scythes.

At the same time, it reached out with one of its human arms to gouge out the eyes on Han Li's central head.

Even with Han Li's incredibly powerful body, he would definitely be severely wounded if these attacks were to land.

However, Han Li seemed to have anticipated this situation, and as soon as he steadied himself, he released his giant staff, which reverted back into three massive mountains that shielded him from the Stemborer Queen's attacks.

The Stemborer Queen's sharp limbs flashed through the air, and dozens of deep gouges instantly appeared on the surfaces of the three mountains.

Meanwhile, the Stemborer Queen's human arm lengthened dramatically before skirting around the three mountains like lightning, continuing to reach out toward Han Li's eyes.

Han Li was caught off guard by this crafty maneuver, and it was too late to take evasive measures.

As such, he could only inject his magic power into his silver visor in a frenzy to release a flurry of countless runes while quickly closing his eyes.

The Stemborer Queen's fingers pierced through the flurry of runes like a pair of needles, then struck Han Li's eyelids with vicious force.

Han Li had already mentally prepared himself for the impact, but he still felt as if he had been dealt a hammer blow to the face, and countless golden stars exploded in his field of view.

Despite this, Han Li suddenly let loose a peal of hearty laughter as the three giant mountains abruptly vanished.

At the same time, bright golden and silver light erupted from the surface of his suit of purplish-golden armor, and countless silver spirit patterns detached themselves from his body before vanishing into the Stemborer Queen's body.

The Stemborer Queen was quite alarmed by this turn of events, and it was just about to do something when a series of thick silver chains appeared out of thin air to bind its entire body.
