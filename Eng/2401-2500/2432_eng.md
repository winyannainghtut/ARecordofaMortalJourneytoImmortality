Han Li naturally paid no heed to this, and he raised his giant wooden sword before slashing it through the air again.

The world's origin Qi tremored as another dark green line swept through the air.

Ma Liang's expression changed slightly as he swept both sleeves through the air, releasing a flurry of close to 100 treasures of all types of different descriptions.

The treasures converged toward the green line before exploding into scintillating balls of light.

These treasures were all clearly very formidable, and with each treasure that was detonated, the green line would falter and shorten slightly.

Once all of the treasures had been detonated, the green line finally reached Ma Liang, but at this point, it had been reduced to only just over 100 feet in length.

One of Ma Liang's fingers turned a crimson-golden color, and he slashed it toward the green line in retaliation.

The finger immediately exploded into blood mist, but what little remained of the green line also faded.

At this point, Ma Liang was looking rather worse-for-wear, but he cast a cold gaze toward Han Li, and said, "Unleashing these full-power attacks using that Profound Heavenly Treasure requires an immense amount of magic power expenditure; there's no way a mere Grand Ascension Stage being like you can unleash more than two of those attacks. Hehe, on top of that, you have to maintain that massive sword formation; you can't have much magic power left."

Immediately thereafter, he flipped a hand over to summon a translucent silver flute.

"You'll know soon enough whether I can unleash more than two of these attacks. Besides, it's not like your situation is much better; you're already a spent force," Han Li chuckled coldly before making a grabbing motion with his other five hands, and five heavy golden weapons appeared in his grasp.

"Haha, don't you worry about me; I have more than enough power left to kill you!" Ma Liang chortled in an enraged manner as he brought the flute to his lips.

In the next instant, a burst of silver soundwaves erupted forth alongside the melodious sound of the flute, and the space in the wake of the silver soundwaves was becoming rather blurry and indistinct.

As soon as Han Li heard the sound of the flute, he was struck by a sense of drowsiness, following which his surroundings blurred, and in the next instant, he found himself situated within a churning sea of blood.

Countless malicious creatures rushed out of the sea of blood, and almost all of them possessed auras at the Grand Ascension Stage.

"Hmph, you think a mere illusion like this can fool me?" Han Li remained completely unfazed as he lashed out with his five golden weapons, sending formidable shockwaves proliferating outward in all directions to instantly eradicate the malicious creatures and sea of blood around him.

Even the most profound illusion stood no chance against his almighty attacks.

However, a mocking smile appeared on Ma Liang's face upon seeing this, and he continued to play his flute. His body abruptly blurred, and a projection emerged out of his back before vanishing into thin air.

At the same time, another flurry of soundwaves reached Han Li, and he found himself situated within the illusion he had just eradicated once again.

Han Li faltered slightly upon seeing this, but an enlightened look then appeared in his eyes as he immediately lashed out with his golden weapons again to eradicate the illusion a second time.

At the same time, the Nascent Soul within his dantian made a hand seal, and a burst of cool and refreshing energy instantly flowed through his meridians and into his three heads.

The drowsiness in his mind instantly vanished, and despite the fact that the flute was still being played, no further illusions appeared.

Ma Liang was astonished to see this.

This silver flute was quite ordinary in appearance, but it was one of his most prized treasures, and as long as the opponent's spiritual sense wasn't more powerful than his own, they would be caught in an endless cycle of illusions with no escape.

As such, the fact that Han Li was able to resist the effect of the flute indicated that he possessed superior spiritual sense!

Due to the power of this realm, he was severely debilitated, but his spiritual sense was still definitely no less powerful than that of the average immortal. Thus, he had thought that his flute play would be able to put an end to this battle for sure.

Before Ma Liang had a chance to consider what ability he could unleash next, Han Li took a stride forward and abruptly vanished on the spot.

Ma Liang had a vast wealth of battle experience under his belt, and he immediately reacted, stowing his silver flute away before appearing several hundred feet away in the blink of an eye.

In the next instant, five thick pillars of golden light struck the spot where Ma Liang had been standing just a moment ago, and the entire space warped violently in the face of the fearsome attacks.

Only then did Han Li reappear amid a burst of spatial fluctuations.

A hint of astonishment flashed through Ma Liang's eyes upon witnessing the power of those five golden weapons.

In the face of such devastating attacks, even his true immortal body wouldn't be able to hold up for long, so he immediately abandoned any thoughts of engaging Han Li in melee combat.

Just as Han Li had said, despite his immortal powers, he was a spent force, and he simply wasn't able to unleash many of his abilities.

Right as he was hesitating about how to proceed, Han Li took a stride forward and vanished into thin air again.

Ma Liang's heart jolted slightly upon seeing this, and he also instantly teleported elsewhere.

In the next instant, five pillars of light struck the spot where he had just been standing, and Han Li reappeared before disappearing in a flash once again.

Thus, a chase ensued where Han Li and Ma Liang teleported throughout the area incessantly, while earth-shattering booms rang out with each strike from Han Li.

Thus, Ma Liang was constantly being pressured without being afforded any respite. As a result, his fury was reaching a boiling point, and he finally arrived at a decision.

After appearing at a certain spot, he didn't immediately teleport away again. Instead, he quickly summoned a jade box before tossing it up into the air, then cast a rapid string of incantation seals toward it.

Five thick pillars of light appeared up above to strike the jade box, and it exploded to release a massive crimson fiery cloud.

The fiery cloud then transformed into a crimson wyrm with long feelers all over its body, and the five heavy golden weapons crashed directly toward it.

However, the wyrm was able to destroy the five oncoming weapons with nothing more than a swipe of its tail, following which it appeared beside Ma Liang in a flash as a ball of red light.

The wyrm then transformed into a small crimson figure that was around three feet tall before chortling with glee. "I didn't think you would undo the second seal on my body. Haha, looks like you're in big trouble here. Otherwise, you would've never done something like this."

Right at this moment, Han Li appeared amid a burst of spatial fluctuations, and he took a glance at the crimson figure before unleashing another attack without any hesitation.

Right at this moment, Han Li appeared amid a burst of spatial fluctuations, but after he took a glance at the crimson figure he hesitated and didn't attack again.

"Cut the chit-chat, Huo Xuzi! I need you to kill that man for me right now," Ma Liang ordered with a cold expression.

"I've already regained my freedom; why should I listen to you?" the crimson figure countered.

"Hmph, looks like you don't want your bonded bead then," Ma Liang said in a cold voice.

"You're willing to return my bonded bead to me? Now that I take a good look at you, you're in a very bad state; no wonder you were willing to release me. However, you have to swear a vow on the name of the Dao Patriarch Jiu Yuan if you want me to assist you here, " Huo Xuzi said.

Ma Liang immediately flared up with rage upon hearing this. "How dare you make such a brazen request!"

"Hehe, if you're unwilling to swear the vow, then I won't help you," Huo Xuzi replied.

"Alright, I can swear a vow on the name of our patriarch, but you have to remain by my side for 10,000 more years after we return to the True Immortal Realm," Ma Liang compromised with a dark expression.

"10,000 years? Hehe, that's not an issue; 10,000 years is nothing more than the blink of an eye for me. I'll take care of this brat for you," Huo Xuzi chuckled.

Ma Liang quickly swore a vow on the name of Dao Patriarch Jiu Yuan, then cautioned, "Don't get careless. You're also restricted by the power of this realm, and your body was damaged in a prior battle, so even though I've undone the second seal, you won't be able to unleash much of your full power."

"Don't worry, I'm well aware of that. I'm only going to help you keep that brat occupied; you'll have to land the killing blow yourself," Huo Xuzi said in a nonchalant manner before turning to appraise Han Li in a disinterested manner.
